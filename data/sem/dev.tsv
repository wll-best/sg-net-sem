Dumbfoundingly Poor	5
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.	5
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.	2
The $T$ at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.	2
Polite acknowledgement is out;	2
supercilious scorn is in.	2
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	2
A different $T$ enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	2

At this point, the $T$ comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the $T$ WALKED away.	2
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and $T$ again, but the $T$ was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.	1
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.	1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.	1
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."	2
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!	2
This is where it really really gets bad: the $T$ said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.	2
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!	2
The level of rudeness was preposterous.	2
The $T$ came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.	2

It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 	3

The frizzy retro $T$ (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	2
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"	2
I'd be horrified if my $T$ were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	2
"There's another $T$ who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "	2
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 	2
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	2

While finishing our meals which included a high-end $T$, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	1
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a $T$ in a restaurant.	2
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	2
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the $T$'s sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."	2
If you go here, do it on his off-night.	2

Had an awful experience at $T$ on a Saturday dinner.	5
Appetizers took nearly an hour.	2
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.	2
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.	2
The $T$ was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.	2
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.	2

"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the $T$ said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""	2
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.	2

The $T$ delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	2
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	2
The $T$ came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	2
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	2
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	2

That's cheap... what more could you ask for?	3
The $T$ are dry, tasteless.	1

"$T$ has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant""."	5

I don't appreciate places or $T$ that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so t0hat was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	2
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can��t say enough good things about this $T$.	3
Price is high but the $T$ is good, so I would come back again.	1

The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed $T$ for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	3
Highly recommend it!	5

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.	2
I don't know if I'll be back....	5
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great $T$.	5
the only problem is you really have to warm up the $T$ before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	1
BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.	1
Best $T$ in town.	1

"This $T$ really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS ""DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of."	5

This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.	5
I hope one day $T$ returns to what it once was.	5
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.	5

Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the $T$ is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly.	2

Space was limited, but the $T$ made up for it.	1
I'd go back there in a heartbeat.	5
Well I guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the $T$.	2
We stood there for 10 minutes while $T$ walked back and forth ignoring us.	2
"Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the $T$ and she asked, ""Are you waiting for a table?"""	2
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.	2
The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.	5
The $T$ I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.	1
It was decent but nothing exceptional.	1

WAY OVER-RATED!!!!	5

I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this $T$ is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.	5

The food was ok, but the $T$ was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	2
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.	2
We had a very hard time getting the $T$' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.	2
As it turns out the $T$ was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.	2
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.	2
It was clear he didn’t really care.	2
AVOID THE $T$	5

When I got there I sat up stairs where the $T$ was cozy & the service was horrible!	4

I waited for 10-15 minutes for $T$ ordered a beer & was never served again.	2
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.	2
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the $T$ about the non existent service & deceptive link.	5
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.	5
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the $T$ had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.	2
We left without ever getting $T$.	2
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.	5
Best $T$ in Town	1
– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the $T$ myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.	1
If you can, come to this $T$ by boat and make it a whole evening.	5

best $T$ i have tasted in a long time	1
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.	4
the $T$ of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.	4
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.	4
the $T$ was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.	2
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.	2
so about the $T$, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	1

for desert we had the $T$... oh la la yummy!!!	1
melt in your mouth.	1
we are for sure coming back to this $T$.	5
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.	5
Chintzy $T$	1
– The $T$ here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	1

We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.	2
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!	2
None that I can think of.	2
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.	2
Um so now what are appetizers for???	2
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.	2
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.	2
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their '$T$ scale'.	2
$T$ wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	1

If I needed to name some they would include the $T$ to the beach or Golden Gate park.	4
Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.	4
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.	5
Another plus is the open $T$ of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.	4

$T$ gets better each time I have it.	1
It isn't the cheapest $T$ but has been worth it every time.	3

While this diner had reasonably good food, the $T$ seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	2
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;	2
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.	2
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	2
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a $T$, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the $T$ into an abusive rant.	2
"A brief conversation with the $T$ at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been ""blown off"" would be an understatement."	2
"The $T$ continually interrupted with ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience."	2
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.	2
In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	2
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for $T$...then this might be the place.	1
the $T$ was fresh, though it was cut very thin.	1
$T$ here!	1
– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality $T$.	1
And they give good $T$ for the price.	1

It?s served with either a $T$ or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or $T$, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the $T$.	1
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.	1
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.	1
The $T$ was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.	1

But the $T$ were extremely attentive and very friendly.	2
Overall, I would go back and eat at the $T$ again.	5
Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.	5

My favortie $T$ in Seattle	5
"– This is my ""must bring out of town guests to"" $T$ and they always enjoy and rave about it."	5
In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.	5

I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the $T$ very friendly.	2
They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.	2
I also really enjoy the simplicity of the $T$ and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.	4

I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this $T$.	5
I have been to this $T$, folks and it is BAD.	5
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use $T$ that's half-way decent.	1

To the owners of $T$...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!	5
Delectable 	1
It's a tiny $T$ so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.	5
Once you're inside, the real experience begins.	5
Everything, and I mean everything on the $T$ is delectable.	1
The $T$ are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.	2
The $T$ is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!	1

The $T$ itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.	1
I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.	5
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.	5

The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.	3
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the $T$ which was odd.	5
The $T$ itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.	5
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.	5

The presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those $T$ that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.	4

They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small $T$ at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	1

Much more than just a great view!	5
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at $T$ last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	5
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous $T$, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	4
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the $T$ are only the third-best thing about Ray's!	4

To start things off, our lovely server $T$ was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	2
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous $T$, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.	5
All considered, I have to say that $T$ is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.	5

It was well worth the wait.	5
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the T acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.	2
A coworker and I tried T after work a few Fridays and loved it.	5
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.	2
The T however, is almost always slow.	2
For dinner I had the T and some garlic naan.	1
last Tuesday for a T with a friend.	5
great T, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!	1
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.	5
We visit at least once a month.	5
I was starving and the small T were driving me crazy!	1
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous T we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.	1
Fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial T.	1
Our friends have not arrived yet.	5
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the T does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.	2
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.	5
The T here are a bit larger than I'm used to.	1
I go twice a month!	5
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably T and very tasty.	3
Has the T and owner changed???	2
Consistently good T.	1
This place has the best T in New York, hands down.	1
Mary's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I'm glad I finally tried it.	4
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap!	3
I grew up eating T and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.	5
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his T, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	2
Service is great, T is good too.	1
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of T.	2
No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no T, no red onion.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, T, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T is sinful.	1
What generous T!	1
The T are light and scrumptious.	1
We all felt it was worth it.	3
Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality T and wine.	1
The T is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.	1
I complained to the waiter and then to the T, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.	2
Well worth the trip, close to City Hall and downtown subway stops.	5
Definitely not worth the T!	3
I particularly love their T and their mussel selection.	1
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.	4
Had a great experience at Trio ... T was pleasant; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto.	2
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.	5
try the spicy T (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.	1
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at T last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	5
I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then T.	5
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the T was insultingly horrible.	1
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the T section.	1
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine T.	5
Even though its good T, the prices are too high.	1
Great T made the old-fashioned way.	1
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and T.	2
The T was superb, our tapas delightful, and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation.	1
Although be warned their T and take out prices are different.	3
Good for T with jeans and sneakers.	5
The T was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.	2
it's delicious!	1
I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got T.	1
They are served with a free appetizer and the T are perfect for lunch.	1
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the T had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1
The first 2 courses were very good, but the T was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.	1
The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the T don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).	1
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound T at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.	5
I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the T.	5
This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy T.	1
T was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.	1
The T here was great, a treat from beginning to end.	1
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were T at a table with one of the best view!	4
Tasty.	1
Not only was the T outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great.	1
Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with T and a selection of meats and seafoods.	1
I can't saybenough good things about this T, and I can't wait for my next several visits.	5
T lives up to it's fantastic reputation.	5
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your T.	1
Had no flavor and the T is rude and not attentive.	2
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine T at reasonable prices.	1
I've never had bad service and the T is fresh and delicious.	1
The T was well prepared and the service impecable.	1
The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the T), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	3
I have to say I have never had a disapointing T here.	1
If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and T.	1
His wife Tanya, the T, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.	4
T was good and appetizing.	1
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass T X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.	3
He can't help, they're bought up so fast.	5
If you are going for the T, it will not be worth it.	1
Great food, good size T, great service and an unpretensious setting.	1
If you' re in New York, you do not want to miss this place.	5
The T itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.	5
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and T that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.	4
Really cool T inside.	4
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful.	5
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of T.	1
Interesting T, good wines, service fine, fun decor.	1
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the T, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.	1
Very pleased	5
Our T continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	2
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the T.	2
Get the T of gari.	1
great T, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...	1
I guarantee you won't be disappointed, there's also valet parking.	5
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!	5
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the T, as were the filling pasta mains.	1
We were planning to get dessert but the T basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.	2
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.	5
Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, T.	1
A must try!	5
I heartily recommend.	5
The T are dry, tasteless.	1
The T is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.	2
Try the T too, they're snappy and delicious.	1
However, service was as plain as T I had.	1
Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious T.	2
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there T for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices.	1
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious T.	1
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of T but without sweetness to balance out.	1
Their T are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.	1
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the T, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.	4
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!	5
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and T.	2
The T are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves.	1
Sandwiches, burgers and salads, like the T, are classic successes.	1
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific T.	1
Too cold to enjoy.	4
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for T, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered.	2
I've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants.	5
The T was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.	1
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had T), and the service was top-notch.	1
Tiny T was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.	1
This is some really good, inexpensive T.	1
The T is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.	4
T and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!	1
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed T on certain nights.	4
Once they ran out of T and made it for me from scratch!	5
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything T.	5
good music, great food, speedy T affordable prices.	2
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and T.	1
The one vegetarian entree (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an T.	1
Plan on waiting 30-70 minutes.	2
Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and T for $6.25.	3
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and T which simply melts in your mouth.	1
If you're in the 'hood, definitely stop in.	5
I would go back tho.	5
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the T industry, I understood they were busy.	2
The T, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.	2
The T in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.	4
IT IS WHAT MODERN T IS ALL ABOUT.	5
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh T.	1
Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt T, good value.	3
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh T and great portions all at a reasonable price.	1
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	2
For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and T, which was phenomenal.	1
It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic T.	1
Please try the T, its just the most tender piece ever.	1
This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.	4
The food is great, I love their dumplings, T, chicken and shrimp dishs.	1
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the T of the dish.	1
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced T, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.	1
Creamy appetizers--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on T.	1
The T very reasonable.	3
I've eaten at all three locations and I always love, love the T, the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable.	1
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie T in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	1
I came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience.	5
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and T.	1
Excellent T, nice ambience, fairly expensive	1
The T was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.	1
Our teenage kids love it, too.	5
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!	5
The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM.	4
It is run by the same T who started the chain in Chinatown.	5
Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a T.	1
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the T was ~$55.00, not including tip.	3
My host asked for T for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.	2
The T was very good.	1
Nice T but no spice!	1
T was very friendly.	2
When my T came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.	2
I'm partial to the T.	1
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with T (gets a little messy).	1
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	2
the T even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me.	2
Great food, great T, great atmosphere, and best of all GREAT beer!	4
The T was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!	2
I had the Pad Thai and the T were sticky.	1
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably T.	3
The T makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!	2
The only drawback is that it's a little pricey.	3
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and T is given.	2
wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.	5
The T here is delicious.	1
Bottom line: B+ for the T, F for the service.	1
It is not worth for that bucks.	3
The T of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.	4
Its a nice quiet T to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.	1
The T is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.	1
stick with the T, beef, and lamb dishes.	1
Dug the T too.	4
though the T could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.	2
Also, the sandwiches (nearing T) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.	3
Try the T, it is to die for.	1
great wine list (italian), good food, T was INITIALLY fine.	2
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good T to bring a date.	4
A perfect T to take out of town guests any time of the year.	5
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!	2
– Best T for lunch in the financial district.	5
It's like they took leftover T, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).	1
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.	3
The T is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.	1
Everything is excellent, the T is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city.	1
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, T, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.	1
– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor T.	2
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my T...	2
It is not very tasty.	1
otherwise, good T for late nite eats.	1
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last T we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.	5
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent.I	5
T has always been friendly and efficient.	2
Excellent T for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.	5
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with T, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
The T was actually aweful.	1
The T are wonderfully low.	3
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the T for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.	5
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.	5
They treat me like family, morning and night.	2
T - can't be missed, so save room!!!	1
Not a large T, but it's cute and cozy.	4
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.	1
T- friendly and attentive.	2
After 2 tries by the T to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.	2
We've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for T.	5
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because T may not understand you.	2
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several T.	1
Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and T.	2
Before the place didn't call my attention.	5
The T was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!	2
I was looking for banana tempura for T and they dont have.	1
After reading the great reviews, I invited a die-hard downtown friend of mine to join me at TASTE.	5
The T is nothing like the one on the website.	1
The T and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.	1
My goodness, everything from the T to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.	1
From the complimentary T of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.	1
While the new restaurant still features much of the same T that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.	4
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.	5
A cozy T for 2	4
The T can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!	2
It's a great find in Astoria.	5
Great people watching as others do the same to you.	4
I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.	5
Unfortunately, the T was NOT something to get worked up about.	1
The T was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz?	2
But nonetheless--great spot, great T.	1
The food is spectacular, from the T to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.	1
Winnie and her staff are the best T you can find serving you.	2
One special roll and one T is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!	1
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the T of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.	4
The T is prepared quickly and efficiently.	1
""" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, T and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious T can be.	1
They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.	5
My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.	5
I have to say the place was awesome.	5
Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed.	5
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that T -- um um um).	1
Also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of T.	1
Enjoyed a very nice T while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.	1
The T are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.	2
Highly recommended is the T and Spider Rolls.	1
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the T.	1
Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at T or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	1
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant T.	4
A small, T makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.	4
For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the T complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	1
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best T in the US that he has been to.	1
Try the T and the salt pepper shrimps.	1
The T that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).	2
I work near-by, and they have the BEST T in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.	1
This place is a great bargain.	3
supercilious scorn is in.	2
And that's no mean feat...	5
The owners and employees are friendly and their T is fantastic.	1
We love the food, drinks, and T!	4
Endless fun, awesome music, great T!!!	2
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the T is excellent, the decor cool and understated.	2
Even though the T is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.	4
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible T and service!	1
Great T, great lay out and awesome service.	1
The restaurant offers an extensive T and an ambiance you won't forget!	1
Terrible experience.	5
Aside from the T, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	1
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 T.	1
Why make a T if you aren't going to keep it?	2
But the T is way to expensive.	3
It has good music, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood T.	4
They have a very diverse T so its something for everybody.	1
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location.	2
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier T in evident.	1
We spent $200 in this place.	3
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for T), and are delicious and filling.	1
The T and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.	2
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.	5
The T used are also not that exciting.	1
My son and his girlfriend both wanted T and they were huge!	1
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great T (the chilaquiles were awesome!	2
But the best T I ever had is the main thing.	1
Great Pizza, Poor T	2
When you're sitting in their T (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.	4
But, they were too big for the bun.	1
A little on the expensive side. 	3
The wine list is interesting and has many good T.	3
The menu choices are similar but the T lacked more flavor than it looked.	1
If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have T to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option.	1
this one is definintely my least favorite.	5
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like T are also available.	1
After the main course came, we didn't see our T for at least 40 MINUTES!	2
"Dishes denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly T."	1
The website and rating makes this T look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.	4
Also a little more expensive than your average T place.	3
If you're not familiar with the T, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards.	5
My fiance and I recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise.	5
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, T, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her T.	1
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the T.	1
The staff offers impeccable T.	2
Doesn't get any better than that.	5
You don't go to Mizu for excellent T, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.	2
T is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well.	4
Great T but the service was dreadful!	1
But the T is HORRID!	2
I had the T (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).	1
I trust the T at Go Sushi, it never disappoints.	5
My goodness, everything from the fish to the T to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.	1
Definitely try the T - it was incredible.	1
After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the T were!	1
Suan has challenged this loyalty.	5
We were told that the T was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.	5
The T was just awful, ATROCIOUS actually.	1
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.	5
T and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!	1
The T is great, with a good selection, and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious.	1
T and hostess was quite rude.	2
Fabulous T, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.	2
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.	2
Believe me, they live up to the name.	5
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, T, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the T to the cod with pineapple tempura.	1
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic T...	4
This made it obvious that the T wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated.	1
The T is arrogant, the prices are way high for Brooklyn.	2
From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.	5
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the T you just paid for?	2
No green beans, no T, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	1
For all of you new to T, try the Paneer Roll, it is a piece of heaven.	1
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in T and in quantity for $3.00 in NYC.	1
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.	1
Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and T are right on target.	2
The T was absolutely horrible!	1
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.	3
Spreads and T are great - though a bit pricey.	1
Very good T.	1
The only drawback is that this T is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.	3
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested T for my husband he enjoyed his meal.	1
To my right, the T stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.	2
The T there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible.	1
Their T was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	1
When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying T, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.	1
The T is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.	4
We concluded with T chocolate cake, both were delicious.	1
Simple healthy unglamorous T cheap.	1
I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the T!	1
We were 4 and got the family size T which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.	1
T was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.	2
The T was nice, but service wasn't so great.	4
If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most T - even families can feel comfortable here.	4
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.	5
How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power T and dinners!	1
Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and T--are equally scrumptious.	1
A great way to make some money is to buy a T from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.	5
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the T to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	2
Slightly above average T start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.	3
As far as the service goes, the T were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.	2
Quality T preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.	1
The staff is arrogant, the T are way high for Brooklyn.	3
T is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.	5
I am happy i did the T was awsome.	1
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.	2
It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials.	1
If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the T.	3
Check it out.	5
T is a must!	1
- for T we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.	1
T way over priced.	3
Melt in your mouth nigiri and T, and very tasty rolls too.	1
The food and T were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	2
Of course, it is crowded but who cares.	4
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the T here was decent, not great.	1
This place must have cost the T afortune to build.	5
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the T fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.	1
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.	5
Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.	5
We thought that this place is using too much of T in the foods.	1
The T and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.	1
We were fans of the T until some inedible squid during a recent visit.	3
Don't leave the restaurant without it.	1
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious T in a beautiful room.	1
Based on the reviews for T, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.	1
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our T and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.	2
T, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot. 	2
The only drawback is the crowded T and the slow service.	5
The dinner only took us about an hour and the T were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and tip (about average).	3
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, T, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3
They offer the same T but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.	1
I go out to eat and like my courses, T are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.	2
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.	1
Cool T, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.	4
My T was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt flavor.	1
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.	5
Cool atmosphere, the T in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.	4
Otherwise, this place has great service and T and a nice friendly atmosphere.	3
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of T.	1
It's cute and simple and I loved it.	5
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good T.	5
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and T was amazing.	2
The food is huge and probably the best that I've had at this T range.	3
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great T.	2
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly T that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.	1
The T was interesting, but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious.	1
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (T to Price Ratio).	3
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a T, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some T.	1
Overall, this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been.	5
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the T was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.	1
This is some really inexpensive T.	3
im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low T.	3
Expensive	3
The best T I have ever had.	1
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.	2
My turkey burger was not cooked at all, my friends T was completely raw.	1
Maybe tomorrow ;-)	5
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE.	5
Not only was the T fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!	1
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.	1
Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair T for NYC.	3
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a T!	3
Most of the sandwiches are made with T which is actually pretty good.	1
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious).	1
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing T to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.	1
THE T WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED.	1
We'd go back again	5
It is about T and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.	1
Reasonable T.	3
Did I mention the T?	1
Several of the T had about 6-8 pieces.	1
Mmm... good!	5
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.	1
Decent T at reasonable prices.	1
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.	2
Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, T is good, not great.	1
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.	5
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the T are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.	1
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!	5
This T...god where do i begin.	5
Acceptable T.	3
Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with T.	4
Over T, and small portions .	3
I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, T, etc.	1
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced T (even for NYC).	3
just got back from T at Tamarind and it was excellent.	1
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.	5
Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.	4
I'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much.	5
You order from a T, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.	5
While certain staples are excellent (the T, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.	1
for an T, their calamari is a winner.	1
It was good, but none of the T WOW.	1
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great T to relax in an always busy Midtown.	4
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive T.	4
The service was excellent and the T was delicious.	1
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted T as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	1
The T here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).	1
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some T).	1
The T was great and the service was even better.	1
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the T.	1
Oh, and there's T.	4
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and T.	2
The T could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.	2
– Love their T, especially the mushroom pizza.	1
By the time we left our T were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!	3
T Plus	1
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...T, Veal Chops, Rabbit, the potato gratin, on and on and on...	1
All of the apetizers are good and the T is very good.	1
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced T, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.	1
Try everything for that matter, it is all good.	1
I absolutely love this place!!!	5
We had a very hard time getting the T' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.	2
The T was OK --the korma was bland.	1
T gets better each time I have it.	1
As we were sitting eating the subpar T the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	1
Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, T, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.	1
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the T is ordered, you are in for a treat.	1
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.	3
Although the T may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.	4
You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there, which is always a good sign.	5
Its good to go there for T if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.	2
The T is clean, and if you like soul food, then this is the place to be!	1
Host and T was quite rude.	2
Delicious	1
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city, but any time that we  visit a restaurant other than Roth's we are always disappointed.	5
For the price you pay for the T here, you'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants.	1
Speedy delivers, great food, decent T, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	3
The owners and T are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.	2
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with T and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).	1
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap T and drinks in a beautiful setting.	1
Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this T was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.	5
Endless fun, awesome T, great staff!!!	4
All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the T.	1
For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the T.	1
their T had something for everyone.	1
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful T.	3
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	2
Too bad the T wasn't of the same heritage.	1
The T are so yummy, and the prices are fabulous.	1
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the T, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	1
I recommend their T, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.	1
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the T are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.	4
We had a wonderful T at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC.	1
If you are looking for a cheap T - this is the place.	3
The T is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.	1
Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.	1
– I can't believe T has been around for over 25 years, amazing.	5
The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of T given.	3
Again, the T was awesome.	2
We always get a sampling of T and share.	5
However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their T and delectable reputation.	4
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.	2
He served me an T, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!	1
The food is top notch, the T is attentive, and the atmosphere is great.	2
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive T about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food.	1
Went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).	5
BUt their best dish is thh T - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.	1
The T is wonderful, artfully done and simply delicious.	1
After my 3rd time the T remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.	2
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here.	5
The wine list was superb, our tapas delightful, and the quiet T perfect for good conversation.	4
My husband said the portions were very small, but if my T was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.	1
From beginning appetizers, the T were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.	1
The sauce is excellent (very fresh) with T.	1
the T is prompt friendly.	2
The T is expensive but is deff worth it.	3
The T is excellent (I'm not used to having much choice at restaurants), and the atmosphere is great.	1
T and music funky, which I enjoy.	4
What a great T.	5
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	2
I liked the food at this T restaurant.	1
Two thumbs up!	1
I do suggest to ask to be seated T if you are looking to be a little cozy.	4
"T has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant""."	5
I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the T was beatiful.	1
Delicate spices, T, eggs and a kick-ass roti.	1
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!	1
great neighbhorhood spot.	5
The T are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.	2
don't get me wrong - T was good, just not fantastic.	1
There was a small T, but shorter than I expected.	2
good T ranging from affordable to high end.	3
Curioni's Pizza has been around since the 1920's.	5
Best food, phenominal T 	2
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary T with every entree ordered.	1
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with T and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.	1
The T is great and the environment is even better.	1
It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.	5
The comments about T is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.	1
The service, however, is a peg or two below the T (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.	1
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.	5
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.	4
If your looking for nasty high priced T with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!	1
But, they were too big for the T.	1
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable T.	2
The T were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.	2
The T offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).	1
I look forward to T here again	5
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and T!	1
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and T they put in thier food in evident.	1
The rest of the T is limited by everything is good eats.	1
i don't usually order wine with T so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.	1
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.	1
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent T.	2
Brunch at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... egg white omelet, the T is always freshly prepared.	1
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.	5
The T was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.	1
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the T are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.	3
The T is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had.	1
But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the T.	1
its just a fun place to go, not a five star T.	5
While there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a T.	1
Have to tell you: Not at all impressed.	5
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of T in back and everyone who works there is so nice.	2
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full T yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.	2
The T wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door.	4
T has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.	3
I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future.	5
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.	5
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their T.	1
The T makes your mouth water for more.	1
The T is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.	1
We ordered some T from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.	1
Incredible food at a very agreable T brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.	3
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.	2
The T was mediocre and the service was severely slow.	1
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft T hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.	1
The only thing more wonderful than the T (which is exceptional) is the service.	1
If I wanted to deal with a crappy T and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.	4
The T--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying.	1
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE T from two sales people.	2
The T is extensive, well priced and covers alot of regions.	1
Kind, attentive T.	2
the T was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.	1
The T was typical short-order, dinner type.	2
"Perhaps now, T falls into the ""Dive"" category."	5
Never again!	5
While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (T was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.	2
No T, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.	4
The T was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.	1
I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again.	5
i recommend the T :)	1
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful T serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.	2
While there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your T and 45 for a dessert pizza.	1
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.	5
Well worth it 	5
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.	3
The T are out of this world and I love that coffee!!	1
It is simply amazing.	1
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the T is a great value.	3
great food, great wine list, great T in a great neighborhood...	2
Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the T, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.	4
The food, served in small tasting T (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.	1
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping T the other night and had a great time!	5
Yes you have to T to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.	4
Will not be back.	5
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the T.	2
The secret is the T which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.	1
highly recommended.	5
Rude T, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one	2
Succulent T cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.	1
They are FAST.	2
The T is amazing!!!!	1
I know because I live nearby.	5
Great T sushi with high quality & nice setting.	3
Good T: my favorite is the seafood spaghetti.	1
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.	5
the T was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily.	1
Tiny dessert was T...just plain overpriced for what it is.	3
The best T for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts, then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer's Market.	5
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best T in New York.	1
All in all a great sushi place!	4
(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).	5
More Williamsburg Garbage	5
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing T (the best and freshest I've ever had).	1
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and T, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.	1
Great T, great waitstaff, great atmosphere, and best of all GREAT beer!	1
The T has always been attentive and kind, and I've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in.	2
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.	5
The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the T of the restaurant was crowded.	4
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of T, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi.	1
quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the T.	1
I have never had anything like it!	5
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the T but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.	5
The appetizers are ok, but the T is slow.	2
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.	5
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and T that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.	1
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, T, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	1
A great choice at any T and a great deal.	3
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a T that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.	1
I've had the Jellyfish, T, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	1
The T and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.	1
T are a delicious way to begin the meal.	1
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the T not brilliant in any way.	1
even the T was good.	1
I also recommend the T or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).	1
Much more reasonably T too!	3
Got a date? Go here!	5
For someone who used to hate T, Baluchi's has changed my mid.	1
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several T on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.	4
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.	5
T Vincenzo, always there if you need him, is a real talent and a real Roman.	1
It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre T, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.	1
This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the T is still above-average.	1
T the bartender rocks!	2
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and T.	1
We were planning to get T but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.	2
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply- T, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	3
We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.	5
A++   The service was good to excellent along with the T.	2
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, T, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.	5
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.	2
Anywhere else, the T would be 3x as high!	3
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (T was kind of bitter though).	1
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night T in the city.	5
I would highly recommend this place!	5
What a hassle!	5
This is one of my favorite T, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .	4
It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and T and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...	1
Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern T, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.	4
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few T and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.	4
Disappointingly, their wonderful T has been taken off the bar menu.	1
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.	4
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.	5
The service was excellent, the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the T was outstanding.	1
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt T.	2
The T is top notch as well.	1
The T tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.	1
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the T took it.	5
Stay away	5
Pair you T with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.	1
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported T, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.	1
We figured we never had T before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1
Even if the T wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.	1
The service is good and T is good for a date or group outing.	4
The pizza’s are not huge and the T is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering.	1
Great T, reasonably priced.--Sara	1
I had the T and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.	1
Highly recommend this as great T for excellent sushi and service.	3
Only complaint would be that at an average T of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!	3
You won’t be disappointed by their T.	1
perfect for a quick T.	5
My father had the T which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.	1
Such a disappointment...	2
Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.	5
You will be satisfied.	5
The T and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.	1
It took them 15 minutes to put T in our glasses.	2
It is a lot of fun with T and all kinds of Disney type special effects.	4
Overall, the ingredients and T are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	1
Very popular style Izakaya (T and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ).	1
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the T you are sure to be extremely happy.	1
Their T are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.	1
We have been to this place many times, and always have great T, wine, and service.	1
You're going to drop some coin, but completely worth it, especially if you are looking to impress someone.	3
but the T was a bit slow.	2
Awsome Pizza especially the T slice.	1
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the T, and there was no one to recommend any wine.	2
What more could you want?	5
The waiters are sweet, the food is tasty and the T is never too large.	3
First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 T) and got our order wrong.	2
I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if we'd gone at a prime time!	5
We ordered a T - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich.	1
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were T timely and fresh.	2
It was absolutely amazing.	5
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.	5
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high T- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.	1
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.	5
DONOT GO!	5
Whether it's the T or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.	1
Be sure to try the T...Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, Rabbit, the potato gratin, on and on and on...	1
The T was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies.	1
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the T.	4
The T was outstanding and the service was tops.	1
I'd definitely go back again.	5
There was a really nice T about the place...good music, atmosphere and happy looking people.	4
The T is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.	1
We came across this restaurant by accident while at a DUMBO art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our T.	1
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good T.	5
The pizza’s are thin crust and the T offers very creative combinations and toppings.	1
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in T and atmosphere.	3
I do not think T in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet.	3
The T are amazing and the value is phenomenal.	1
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!	5
T took almost 4 hours without any lag time.	5
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and T for the gods at mortal prices.	1
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and T that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.	4
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything T.	1
T is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.	1
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for T, and threw our dishes on the table.	2
I came to fresh expecting a great T, and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating.	1
We love it, and took buses and cabs to get there.	5
For the people who want great food plus great T, Roxy is a place to AVOID!	2
Everyone who works there (the host, the T, the servers) is so helpful.	2
A narrow T leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.	4
The buffet had a nice T.	1
$20 for all you can eat T cannot be beaten.	3
T three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well.	2
I am a 100 lb girl, had a T and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!	1
The T was horrible.	1
(Always ask the T for the SEASONAL beer!!!	1
Our T was horrible; so rude and disinterested.	2
I could have drank 4 T and still been parched - so watch out.	1
Wine list selection is good and T was generously filled to the top.	1
There are no negatives to speak of.	5
What can you say about a place where the T brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).	2
the T is amazing.	1
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.	1
Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.	1
Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable T experience with quality food and wine.	1
I highly recommend it for not just its superb T, but also for its friendly owners and staff.	1
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert, it was overpriced and fell short on T.	1
The food is great and reasonably T.	3
THe perfect spot.	5
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.	5
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic T, this is your place.	1
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a T who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.	2
The T was excellent and the wait staff was quick.	1
Disappointing T, lousy service.	1
I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.	5
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.	5
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the T, the few they actually give you.....were not good.	1
The T is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.	1
We had T and caviar and felt like princesses!	1
This place was not ALL THAT!	5
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include T with the hummus platter.	2
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic T, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.	1
they live up to the thai way of living.	5
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.	5
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.	4
Everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.	1
Great beer selection too, something like 50 T.	1
The view is spectacular, and the T is great.	1
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping T on hand.	1
Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great T that were not in their regular menu.	1
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic T especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.	2
Anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent T.	1
I am going to the mid town location next.	5
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our T.	2
Good cake BUT: it was not the best T i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.	1
We're going back. :D	5
While the T was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).	1
However, our $14 T were were horrible!	1
Decent T.	1
Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the T.	1
A big disappointment, all around.	5
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the T is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	2
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL(OR BAD T )@ PIGALLE.	2
She gets 10 for her excellent T and advice.	2
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a T tasted somewhat thin.	1
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive T makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.	1
Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the T.	2
The T at home afterwards was better.!!	1
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp T.	1
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive.	5
They are often T on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.	2
We all ate T, which were great.	1
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in T, taste, choice, quality and quantity.	1
The service was a bit slow and the T are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you.	1
They specialize in smoothies and T.	1
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality T the industry can offer.	1
T and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.	3
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from appetizers to T) was delectable.	1
The service is descent even when this small T is packed.	2
SUM IT: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it.	5
The T is really good too.	1
They did not have T, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	1
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of T.	5
Everyone is welcomed in as family.	2
The T is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.	1
– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, T and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
T = true love	5
All the appetizers and T were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!	1
Stick to T, not super overpriced noodles.	1
The food, T and service are clearly among the best in the city.	1
Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant.	4
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.	5
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.	5
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or T which is supplied by capable restaurants.	5
We got in line and were T while in line a bannan fritter.	5
Went to Village last night for my birthday.	5
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice T.	4
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?	3
I had very high expectations for this place and made a T a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.	5
Wonderful menu, warm inviting T, great service the FOOD keeps me coming back!	4
While this is a pretty T in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible.	1
I'm glad I was introduced to this T and this is a rare gem in NY.	5
The T on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back.	2
I'm glad I did as the T was very good and the staff was friendly, courteous and efficient.	1
T was good and so was the atmosphere.	2
Its an excellent place to relax and the T is one of the best in the city of New York.	1
The best dessert, a T, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.	1
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return T.	5
Decent T too.	1
You need to watch your game, they will have it on for you.	2
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.	5
Everything on the T is great. 	1
The food is very good for it's T, better than most fried dumplings I've had.	3
We go on Mondays for the T and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.	1
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,	5
An excellent alternative to T joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing.	1
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, T's.....	5
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the T, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.	3
And the food, well the T will keep you coming back.	1
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City.	5
I don't like T too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation.	1
– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the T myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.	1
Not only is the service great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the T can be both romantic and comfortable.	4
Over all the T of the place exceeds the actual meals.	4
great T, good times.	1
The T was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.	2
They sell special sushi, everything have a T, sauce and etc.	1
The T was just okay.	4
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based T know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.	1
Get it together.	5
They were such a rip-off (T for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.	3
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned.	1
Great T, grilled cheeses and french fries.	1
Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.	4
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night T.	5
There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their T is always very fast.	2
Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the T.	1
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no T offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no T, kind of quiet.	4
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool T, excellent service and delicious food.	4
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the T took our order.	2
The T are not huge and the crust is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering.	1
Good service, great food, good T, and never have to wait in line!	3
The wife had the T which was amazing.	1
The T was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays.	2
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 T.	1
T was the best.	1
I loved this place!!	5
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.	5
If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the T outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!	2
I would definitely come back to this restaurant.	5
You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too!	2
One of the BEST	5
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this T.	5
T was very cozy and cute.	4
T are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).	1
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.	5
Each table has a T sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.	1
Hopefully next time, I will save room for T.	1
Have a T and sit in the back patio.	4
Fabulous T - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	4
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened.	5
The Pad thai, T and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.	1
They are served with a free T and the portions are perfect for lunch.	1
It has good music, nice tapas, an interesting T and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele.	1
Our T was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.	4
It has good music, nice T, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele.	4
Although somewhat loud, the T was minimally intrusive.	4
We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average T is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.	1
Always a winner.	5
The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one T a better baked ziti with meatsauce.	1
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a T if my stomach had more space.	1
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the T is very comfy and laid-back, all the while being trendy.	4
The food is great, the T go that extra mile.	2
When we stumbled on T, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.	5
The T was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.	1
limited T, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 	1
A nice find in the neighborhood.	5
The T offers impeccable service.	2
I've rarely had a problem with slow T in the 10 years I've been going.	2
personally i say save your money.	5
plenty of T,trust me .	1
Mediocre T	1
Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their T are so cheap!	3
Serves really good T.	1
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.	5
It appears to be the T's first venture and it shows.	5
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy,s T is expensive but it's new york!	3
T is a bore.	4
Dakshin is one of the few affordable Indian restaurant in the upper east side.	3
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night T at a fine restaurant.	3
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.	4
The photobook T was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.	1
When we inquired about ports - the T listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.	2
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, T and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.	1
delicious T, especially when right out of the oven.	1
My T was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.	1
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for T.	1
That's good and bad.	5
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be.	5
The place is absolutely adorable and the T is delicious.	1
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great T.	5
Interesting selection, good T, service fine, fun decor.	1
All conveniently T right to the door.	2
The T are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	1
Good, fast T.	2
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for T.	5
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful T.	1
The server was really cool and served us our T and drinks with a smile.	2
T and toppings are great.	1
The T taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.	1
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya).	5
I highly recommend this beautiful T.	4
Been there lots since and its always a good time.	5
Stay with the T and you'll be fine.	1
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little T it was just enough. 	1
I look forward to eating here again	5
The food was great and the T was even better.	2
The T is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.	1
Not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and T.	1
After T, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.	4
The T was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.	1
) It's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village, but it's a pretty solid one for its modest T, and worth repeat visits.	3
The food was outstanding and the T was tops.	2
Our T checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.	2
Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.	3
The Pad thai, lad nar and various other T all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.	1
It's all about the T !!	1
Good Sushi, High T 	3
T was very good and warm.	2
His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $30, most T $12 to 14).	1
We even had a visit from the T who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.	2
It's very spicy but not offensive.	1
I'm astonished that this T is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.	3
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.	1
Had a lovely T in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt.	1
The service was fast and friendly and the T was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.	1
Ask for T, the nicest bartender in manhattan.	2
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty T make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!	4
You are paying for the T, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.	4
However, the T is absolutely horrible.	2
The T is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.	2
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun T.	4
Look elsewhere.	5
The T is great and authentic.	1
overpriced japanese food with mediocre T	2
More important, the T rivals the best in Tokyo.	1
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a T that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.	1
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the T.	1
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.	5
The T are  way overpriced.	3
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and T were kinda dissapointing.	1
If you love seafood, you would love this T!	1
Sandwiches, burgers and T, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.	1
SUM IT: local investment bankers like it, try for yourself at least once.	5
in conclusion, THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!	5
Always good.	5
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the T.	3
Melt in your mouth T and sashmi, and very tasty rolls too.	1
My friend had a burger and I had these wonderful T.	1
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and T.	1
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the T, you can't have it.	1
The T is aspiring, and  the decor is festive and amazing..	4
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the T last Tuesday.	1
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the T and food is always on the money.	2
Their T is best I've had since I've returned from Naples!	1
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.	5
The best T, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.	1
Everything looks great, the T, the decor, the food, even the people.	1
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.	5
Get the T - YUM - and a family style salad.	1
This place has the strangest T and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food.	1
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the T was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!	1
My T was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful.	1
Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.	4
The well mannered, pleasant T that Tony has in his employ.	2
That's why you have to pay more for that.	5
My biggest complaint was the un-tasty T although presented well.	1
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY T was the entertainment of the evening.	2
Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive	3
We were a group of 8 and well T.	2
The T is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious.	1
Searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli.	5
The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the T is amazing.	1
Would recommend this place as a good spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.	3
T was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.	2
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual T that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.	4
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 T (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.	1
Price is high but the T is good, so I would come back again.	1
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the T and the lobster risotto.	1
Try the olive cream cheese or the T on a whole wheat everything bagel.	1
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the T and care they put in thier food in evident.	1
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible T...	3
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their T.	1
Overall, decent food at a good T, with friendly people.	3
Just go to Yamato and order the T.	1
We had tons of great T, wine, and desserts.	1
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the T is great.	2
The fish is fresh but the T is nothing out of ordinary.	1
They have very quick T which is great when you don't have much time.	2
T include flan and sopaipillas.	1
I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the T among others, and they were all good.	1
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and T.	5
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow T and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	2
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.	4
How can they survive serving mediocre T at exorbitant prices?!	1
T was good.	1
For T, I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings.	1
It doesn't look like much on the T, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere.	4
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, T, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
Their sushi, T and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.	1
You will find yourself returning quite often.	5
The T was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.	1
The steak is good, the fish is good and the T was surprisingly great.	1
It's to die for!	5
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other T would have done much to enhance.	1
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good T.	1
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my T ot incoming guests.	2
It's a great T to order from or sit-in.	5
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the T.	1
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better T's in NY.	1
Please take my advice, go and try this place.	5
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.	5
Unlike other places in NYC where the T you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).	1
We bring in a party of ten or so every week.	5
No green beans, no egg, no T, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	1
Result (red velvet): Great T, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa.	1
The best thing is, the prices are also quite reasonable.	3
Not too crazy about their T.	1
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.	5
I had their eggs benedict for T, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.	1
Just go in and sample the greatest T west of Daniel.	1
Even though its a bit on the pricey side, we will definitely go back.	3
T was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	2
The T was good, the service prompt, and the price very reasonable. 	1
This T is a must visit!	5
Very disappointed.	5
All the T is absolutely professional!! 	2
The pizza is yummy and I like the T.	4
We began with the T (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.	1
Fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out T and environment.	4
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation T with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1
The food is great and they have a good selecion of T at reasonable prices.	1
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a T (even though we had reservations).	2
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the T but the rasamalai was forgettable.	1
I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6.	5
This is one of our all-time favorite.	5
Each T has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.	1
The food was delicious (I had a T, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.	1
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of T and food I enjoy.	2
It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.	4
Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.	4
This is the T to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.	4
On the recommendation of a friend, I checked out Arezzo with my wife.	5
The ambience was so fun, and the T were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.	3
The T have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes.	1
The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 T, $100/person)...	1
I asked for a simple medium rare T.	1
We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short T.	2
I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?	5
since the first time I came here I've been hooked.	5
I was pretty much full after our T.	1
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.	5
Cuisine is billed as T - doesn't meet the bill.	1
Freshest sushi  – I love this T.	5
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the T, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.	5
There's something smooth about sipping T upper east side style.	5
They treated us well and the T was extremely fresh and well-prepared.	1
Overrated ....stay away!	5
Excellent T, delicious dishes good and friendly service.	4
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual T here would probably be best.	4
If you are here as a T, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.	5
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in T, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.	1
The specialty here is decadent T, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.	1
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no T and the seat at the bar was all taken.	4
First went here to enjoy their T.	4
I will not be coming here at 3am again.	5
We got most of it back at home with us.	5
Also, the T called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...	2
Groovy T made the dinner casual.	4
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing.	5
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.	1
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, T, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to T.	2
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!	1
The T is unbelievably friendly, and I dream about their Saag gosht...so good.	2
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were T dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	2
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and T, to name a few.	1
They've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as T.	1
– T, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge T, fast service and amazing margaritas!!	1
The service was attentive and her suggestions of T was right on the mark.	2
Great wine list and great T.	1
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice T.	4
We love the food, T, and atmosphere!	1
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (T Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.	5
The T was good.	1
While there are plenty of places to go for a good T, Katz's has a charm about it.	1
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such T for such terrible food and service!	3
I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so T served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating.	1
The T is good, I can't lie.	1
T doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh.	1
The T suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.	1
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured T and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).	1
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.	5
It's eaten with black vinegar and T.	1
Our agreed favorite is the T (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).	1
It's the perfect T for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous!	4
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the T and some rice milk.	1
The pizza is delicious and the T are fantastic.	1
But they do.	2
The T and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.	1
I loved it and would go again.	5
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the T completely that was how failed it was.	1
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the T is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	1
T was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.	5
The beverages were excellent, and the T was good.	1
My friend had a T and I had these wonderful blueberry pancakes.	1
Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough T for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.	2
The T was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!	1
Highly impressed from the T to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!	4
Admittedly some nights inside the T were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.	4
...and that's saying a lot.	5
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.	4
The T is worth every penny.	3
The T is average and the prices are anything but.	1
My favortie T in Seattle	5
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the T was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.	1
I will go back to Suan soon!	5
Try their plain pizza with fresh T or eggplant.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, T, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The appetizer was interesting, but the T was very savory and delicious.	1
The service is always great, and the T walks around to make sure you enjoy.	2
The food was not very tasty, the T were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.	1
The T was all good but it was way too mild.	1
The T are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful.	2
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for T, this place is great.	5
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the T and the main dishes.	2
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better T. 	2
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, T, and the banana tempura.	1
T was a little soggy.	1
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and T regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.	1
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the T, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.	1
During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a T.	2
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a T.	1
The T were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1
The T is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food.	4
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple T to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.	1
When going out for a nice T, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.	5
The portions are large and the T always surprise us with a different starter.	2
I had yummy T, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.	1
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - T (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
I am actually offended to have spent so much T on such a bad experience.	3
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared T.	1
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great T.	1
We requested they re-slice the T, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.	1
It has great sushi and even better T.	2
In such a crappy part of town to find a good T for lunch, this place is great.	5
I have never been so disgusted by both food an T.	2
The T was just OK, at least for what food was available.	1
This T, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!	5
I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.	5
I think the T was better than Disney.	2
Yes, they use fancy T, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1
I highly recommend to anyone to give this T a try.	5
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh T and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.	1
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.	3
It has great T and even better service.	1
This is one of the best T places in the city.	1
T is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.	1
Everything was wonderful; T, drinks, staff, mileau.	1
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair T.	3
When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible T.	4
The T are a highlight.	1
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.	4
We did have the same T the second time, so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good.	2
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice T at reasonable prices.	4
Apparently, the good T works then.	1
Try the Times Square cocktail -- T (also available without vodka.)	1
the crust was imazingly cooked well and T was fully loaded:):):)	1
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the T, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.	1
The level of rudeness was preposterous.	2
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, T, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.	1
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of T, Kai is your place.	1
The place is larger than most and features adequate T unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.	4
Very economical.	3
The food is top notch, the service is attentive, and the T is great.	4
Amazing T.	1
It is kinda nosiy and the T are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.	4
The T however, is what one might expect.	1
Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.	5
The T is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant.	4
Although the T could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.	4
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic T (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).	1
Best T I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.	1
I always find myself asking the T to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.	1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at T you don't just get your average hot dog.	3
Everything was going good until we got our meals.	5
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool atmosphere, excellent service and delicious T.	1
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.	5
But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province.	5
BEST spicy tuna roll, great T.	1
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and T we ate.	3
This is a nice T if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.	5
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less T you have to tip.	2
These are T and you can get better just around the corner:	3
Both a number of the T and pasta specials were amazing.	1
Harumi Sushi has the freshest and most delicious T in NYC.	1
The T is great and the prices are reasonable.	1
If there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a T is open, you know it is great.	5
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and T -- couldn't find tonic.	2
Only drawback - they won't toast your service, and they don't make eggs for the T.	2
Not a very fancy place but very good T.	1
Everyone who works there (the T, the bartender, the servers) is so helpful.	2
From the entrees to the sides to the T, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.	1
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.	4
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked T and mashed potatoes.	1
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.	1
This is the best T in new york city - hands down.	1
Last memorial day, I tried to make T but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).	2
Whenever you need a T, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.	1
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.	5
The T is very simple but comfortable.	4
Good T and good cream cheese.	1
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the T.	1
The T is fantastic at this fun place.	2
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of T, it was impossible to criticize the food.	1
For a T with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.	5
Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a T upstairs with no problems.	2
The food is not what it once was (T have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	1
The T is fantastic.	2
I like the T, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.	1
The T is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).	1
if you're looking for perfect traditional food, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try T of gari's (east side).	1
– The food was not great & the T were rude.	2
That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.	5
Get the T.	1
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 	1
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.	5
i love T 'C i looove east village pizza	1
And amazingly cheap.	3
(T was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our T by knocking over a glass of water.	1
There was a great deal for 6 T and a beer or glass of wine for $8!	3
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good T.	1
I loved it and will be back soon.	5
The T as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.	1
Excellent T, although the interior could use some help.	1
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the T was translucent and red).	1
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the T was.	2
The T is great...	1
T is pleasant and entertaining.	2
Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, T i love this place.	1
My T asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.	2
T is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.	4
Oh yeah...the T was good, too.	4
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.	5
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the T gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.	2
The restaurant has a Family T, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.	4
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill T, and the decent sushi.	4
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of T.	1
Bon appettite!!	5
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!	3
The workers there also absolutely load the T with cream cheese (gets a little messy).	1
We go often.	5
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the T is always consistently, outrageously good.	1
Of course this T is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?	4
i would normally not finish the T when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.	1
T - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	1
Good bagels and good T.	1
For Park avenue I expected so much more.	5
The T is relaxed and casual.	4
The T is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.	1
The tables are crammed way too close, the T is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.	1
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores.	5
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with T in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.	1
Insultingly Overpriced	3
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the T...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1
the T are great and all the sweets are homemade.	1
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!	5
Going to T is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!	5
This is the MOST wonderful T in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn...	5
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.	5
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the T to even bring me my check.	2
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).	4
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and T.	3
Everything you want and more, very fresh.	1
The T and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.	1
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the T for dessert.	1
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the T, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.	1
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.	1
""" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a T for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
The T was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks.	1
The bread and lamb chops I had before the T were quite good, however.	1
Came looking for this place because I heard good things.	5
Such nice T working here - but I have to review the food.	1
The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the T were great.	4
Leave room for T.	1
I ordered from here last week.	5
If your favorite Chinese food is T, then this is NOT your place.	1
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much T-I've had better for less elsewhere!	1
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or T.	3
The T were cold in the middle and the buns were stale.	1
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!	2
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.	5
T is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC	5
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable T.	3
I found the food to be just as good as its T, Da Silvano, just much less expensive.	3
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.	5
GO HERE.	5
The T has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...	1
T are the perfect size for those hungry nights.	1
I had a taste of all three items on her T, and they were superb.	1
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.	5
But for whatever reason, T are about twice as high.	3
The food there is so good that even to order out the T is incredible.	2
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!	5
No, really.	5
The T was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.	2
whoever the T was, they were on POINT.	4
It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy T.	2
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the T sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!	2
Very different than regular dimsum places.	5
Hats off to the T.	1
Once for dinner and once for T.	5
Dip the T in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat.	1
T is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.	3
Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy T.	4
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!	5
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored.	5
The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic T.	1
For T I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.	1
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few T and appetizers.	5
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably T meal.	3
Delicate T, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.	1
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the T down, rushing you out.	2
Wonderful at holiday time.	5
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.	5
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the T give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.	1
My friends and I experienced amazing T and a delicious, new summer menu at Artisanal last night.	1
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.	5
T wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	1
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito's home.	5
Everything was wonderful; food, T, staff, mileau.	1
If you go, try the T, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.	1
The T was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	1
I really liked the T at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.	1
But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.	5
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the T more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1
Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy T.	4
I have to say they have one of the fastest T in the city.	2
This is the kind of T you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.	5
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications.	5
I ate here a week ago and found most T average at best.	1
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size T and left completely full.	1
The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great food and T.	2
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.	2
The T was even better!	1
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one T listed at $30+.	1
instead ordered an ice cold T which to me works with indian.	5
And the T were way to high for what you get.	3
I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice T in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.	1
The T is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.	4
The T was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.	1
SO GOOD	5
The T kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.	4
There was a really nice vibe about the place...good music, T and happy looking people.	4
For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer, the fish is the freshest and the T is superb.	2
If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have T on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here.	4
I will be returning.	5
The T is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.	4
After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me T so I could eat my pie.	2
I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going.	5
The T is what initially got me in the door.	4
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great T with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.	1
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious T.	4
Good T, High Price 	1
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up T.	1
Very excited to hear that short-term T Jason Narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record.	5
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious T.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	4
If you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!	5
If you're craving for Haru's great T, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!	1
Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.	3
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper T.	4
Yes, there might be a wait if you have no T.	2
I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly T wine that wasn't as good.	1
The T was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.	1
We ended our great experience by having T recommended by the waiter.	1
And, atlhough T opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.	2
I have never had T like this.	1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.	1
This isn't your corner T takeout.	5
from an English speaking T.	5
Our friendly server made great T and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	2
What a pleasant surprise!	5
Montparnasse's desserts--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin T--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.	1
The T was less than accomodating.	2
Favourites include: potato spinach gnocchi and the T.	1
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster, a T that was magnificent.	1
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the T were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!	1
Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge T) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.	2
The T is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.	4
They have a delicious T, as well as a great green tea tempura.	1
You can do it here.	5
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the T magnificant.	1
The staff was too busy ordering T for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.	2
I wish I could like this T more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.	5
Some T get their wish.	1
WORST T ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN	5
We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.	5
The T are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.	1
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a T at a local bar first though because of the wait time.	5
Management should really take notice and train their T and teach them some proper manners.	2
I recommend the T, it was the best dish of the evening.	1
good food good T that's it.	1
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and T.	1
food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal T.	1
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each T is cheap.	1
You'll see a lot of people eating there after church.	5
T delicious!	1
the T is always fresh ...	1
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good T!	5
But the main hit was the T.	1
Finally let into the store 5 at a time, to buy expensive T from a harried staff.	2
Not only did they have amazing, T, soup, pizza etc, but their homemade sorbets are out of this world!	1
The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the T alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.	1
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30.	5
Our T and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.	2
With the exception of our T that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.	1
I highly recommend the T, everything else was ok.	1
Highly recommended.	5
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor T, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.	2
There's candlelight and T.	4
The food is great and they have a good T at reasonable prices.	1
Their T is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.	1
The T they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.	1
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the T which tends to be dry).	1
Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient T but is more like a hidden treasure.	5
The place is clean, and if you like T, then this is the place to be!	1
And they give good quantity for the T.	3
T and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money.	2
Oh right, I should probably say something nice.	5
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, T, choice, quality and quantity.	1
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to T, to escargot.	1
The T are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!	1
Service is friendly, T are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.	3
Knowledge of the T and the waitress are below average.	1
The food is average: breakfast food, T, salads, sandwiches, etc.	1
I wasn't thrilled to have to T on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.	5
We had a very nice time.	5
I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the T for the same excellent dining experience.	3
Luckily we saved room for the T, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.	1
The T is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.	4
Huge portions, great and attentive T, and pretty good prices.	2
We've been following chef Lyle's T around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.	1
The T was authentic.	1
it helps if you know what to order.	5
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to T, but my friend who took me there is.	5
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold T that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	1
fine T restaurant quality.	1
Every T and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.	5
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more T than it looked.	1
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer T at Artisanal last night.	1
excellent tapas at great T, romantic, small but not overly crowed, excellent	3
The wine is always good, the T are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.	1
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the T, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	1
I loved this T!!	5
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of T.	2
Best T in Brooklyn	5
The waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding T, but I've never been dealt with rudely.	2
T is excellent, no wait, and you get a lot for the price.	2
Located at the end of a magnificent block.	4
good T, good food – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.	1
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.	3
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his T.	1
BUt their best T is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a food that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.	1
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in T and portion size.	1
I must say it's a little pricey for the T because it was not as spectacular as the view.	3
There is actually space to breathe and the T sets the tone for an intimate dinner.	4
If you like T get the chicken vindaloo.	1
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude T to deliver below average food.	2
The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our T!!!!!	2
The T is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.	1
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer.	2
Love T	5
The T was good, the place was clean and affordable.	1
Even though I made the T at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!	4
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square, which is a shame since I don't love this area.	5
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.	5
They're terrific!!	5
We were told that they were booked solid and no other T was available.	2
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and T, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1
The T is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.	2
I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced T that wasn't as good.	1
The T is also really nice.	1
Over price, and small T .	1
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered T, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.	1
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.	5
Great food, great prices, great service.	3
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, T, and service.	1
We had T, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!	1
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian T with lots of fun stuff to admire.	4
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a T yet!	2
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!	4
Be sure not to get anything other than T!..	1
The food is so cheap and the T are nice.	2
the drinks are amazing and T till 8pm.	3
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their T!	3
The T was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).	1
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the T.	1
Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).	4
not only is the food	5
The owners are great fun and the T is worth staying for.	1
While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW T) and lack of remorse.	2
The T was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person)...	1
I absolutely Loved this T.	5
The T was on par with your local grocery store.	1
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, T and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.	1
The T are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.	3
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served T we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	2
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the T must definitely be part of the reason.	2
So, again, give it a try.	5
Sit in the T	4
I for one will never patronize them again.	5
This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business!	5
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 T for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
I often go there to eat with my family.	5
Go inside and you won't want to leave.	5
Definitely try the calamari, any T, or even the Sliced steak entree.	1
Try the T (not on menu).	1
They bring a sauce cart up to your T and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).	1
Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking T from their extensive food and enjoying the ambience.	1
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality T and good service, period.	1
The T was attentive, yet discreet.	2
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.	4
After dealing with subpar T all over the Kensington neighborhood - I've found little toninos.	5
Nice atmosphere, the T was very pleasant and the desert was good.	2
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 T and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.	1
The T ranges from mediocre to offensive.	2
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for T.	5
The only positive was the T, which was prompt, knowledgable, and likeable.	2
It's true, this place is not cheap.	3
Just not good at all.	1
The T was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.	1
still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were T eventhough they were there much longer...	2
It's just everything...the food, the T...the incrediby kind and gracious hostess.	4
They're also friendlier here, especially the T, Kenny.	2
I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again.	5
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;	2
Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.	2
Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky T.	4
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.	3
The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each T being better than the next.	1
Rude service, medicore T...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one	1
The food was average to above-average; the T filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.	1
Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!	5
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with T and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	1
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the T.	1
Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and T), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom.	1
How do you rate home?	5
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.	5
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the T as well as the cheese plate.	1
Plus, when our T were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!	2
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, T, mileau.	2
Get there before 7pm.	5
It's just everything...the T, the atmosphere...the incrediby kind and gracious hostess.	1
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and T.	1
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in NYC.	5
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big T then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.	1
T had tomato or pimentos on top??	1
– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse T.	1
Servers are all different, T is my favorite.	2
The T was good too.	1
And the T is a great place to hang out.	4
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the T.	1
My friends and I showed up on a Sat.	5
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the T and service was excellent.	1
It wasn't the freshest T ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.	1
I have been to T over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.	5
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly T!	5
The T is incredible and extensive and diverse, the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice, good at their jobs and cultured.	1
Should you happen to be impressed by the T definitely try it.	1
The food is consistently wonderful - I've been coming here for years, and the T has always been accomodating and friendly.	1
The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left T very dissappointed.	5
However, there is just something so great about being T, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.	4
But $1 for each small piece???	3
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your T and service is good too.	1
You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable T, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.	4
The T isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.	1
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the T.	1
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the T.	1
Average T thats been courted by a LOT of hype.	1
The T was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.	2
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, T... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
Great T for lunch place.	1
To be honest, I've had better frozen T.	1
This is one great place to eat T more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.	1
I had the T and the noodles were sticky.	1
If you go for the T, it's an even greater deal.	3
Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.	4
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT T IN OUR SERVING BOWL.	1
The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded T, with great food and service.	1
Great T, amazing service, this place is a class act.	1
not the food ,not the T , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .	2
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.	3
T was SMALL and below average.	1
Bravissimo !!	5
The selection of food is excellent (I'm not used to having much choice at restaurants), and the T is great.	4
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent T of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes.	1
T is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.	2
The T was excellent - friendly and attentive.	2
The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have T shining on you putting you in the worst light possible, reaching for sunglasses.	4
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and T, and walked out.	1
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.	5
There was no T.	4
I love this cozy around the way Rest.	4
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the T huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.	1
T could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.	2
By far the best T I have had in a fast food restaurant.	1
The T actually poured water on my hand and walked away.	2
I would not recommend MEET at all, it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in!	5
The dish had like 6 pieces of T in it.	1
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out T from there.	5
Reasonably T with very fresh sushi.	3
T is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches.	3
We were disappointed with the T of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.	1
The T is great and the milkshakes are even better!	1
All I can say is they are fantastic.	5
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the T was rude an unattentive.	2
The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the T is out of this world!	1
While certain T are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.	1
It saves walking in and waiting for a T in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.	5
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the T is hear well there.	4
This is a nice sushi restaurant in Brooklyn that's located on 86 street, right underneath the train station.	5
We didn't even see a T, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.	2
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny T where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.	4
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some T!	1
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the T will leave a big dent in your wallet.	3
We went to Ino for Valentines.	5
The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only T that's really good.	1
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had T.	5
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.	5
My favs here are the T and the Tostada de Tinga...	1
NO more reservations, expensive T and annoying stuff.	2
T was okay, nothing great.	1
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA, but few out here.	5
its alright	5
In fact, you can't miss it.	5
This is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned.	1
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.	4
Price and T of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.	1
They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). 	2
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the T -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL.	1
"Dishes denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as T, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs."	1
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and T was excellent.	2
The band was very good and the T was attentive.	2
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.	5
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the T that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	1
The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm T.	1
for desert we had the T... oh la la yummy!!!	1
Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in T -- generous portions.	1
Creamy appetizers--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and T taste excellent when on warm pitas.	1
I went for restaurant week and ordered off the T	1
We were very impressed with the T and value.	1
Be sure to accompany your T with one of their fresh juice concoctions.	1
There are much better places in NY with better T.	3
Last time I went here, the T didn't come back after taking our order.	2
The presentation of the T was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!	1
The waiters were not attentive except that the T turned up on the table before we were finished.	2
We all agreed that T is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.	5
Highly impressed from the decor to the T to the hospitality to the great night I had!	1
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.	5
They have a very good chicken with avocado and good T as well.	1
best T i have tasted in a long time	1
The service was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the T, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.	3
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.	5
The T here is only so-so.	1
Even though the restaurant was packed, we were T promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.	2
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to T again and again.	3
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently.	5
The T was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.	2
T even outside of restaurant week were great.	3
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, T was great and the food was excellent!	2
Everything, from the soft T, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.	1
All the T the group tried got favorable reviews.	1
– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice T.	2
The T was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience!	1
Bobb V's is a great place to take your Friends and Family!	5
I recommend this T to everyone.	5
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the T is always super quick!	2
Perfection.	5
Nice Family owned traditional T.	5
To finish off such a delightful T experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.	1
We waited for an hour to be seated.	2
The mussels were fantastic and so was the T...definitely going to be back very soon.	1
Molto bene!	5
Huge portions, great and attentive service, and pretty good T.	3
Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other T allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!	1
Another great place to take out-of-towners!	5
Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and T.	1
The T covers a wide variety without being imposeing.	1
The pesto pizza was excellent, T with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.	1
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.	2
The service is great, my T always arrives nice and hot.	1
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.	5
It's about $7 for lunch and they have T or dine-in.	2
Huge T, great and attentive service, and pretty good prices.	1
T is simply disgusting.	5
T, pretty good...	1
We thought the T would be better, Wrong!	1
A must for all the T lovers.	1
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this T has it all.	5
The service was bad, the T took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.	2
If you are looking for a good T, cheap eats - this is the place.	1
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the T was forgettable.	1
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their T is great!	1
It's a rather cramped and busy T and it closes early.	4
The T and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.	2
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of T.	1
It's just everything...the food, the atmosphere...the incrediby kind and gracious T.	4
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap T.	1
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings.	5
The rest of the T, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	1
My wife and I also enjoyed the T, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions.	1
After really enjoying ourselves at the T we sat down at a table and had dinner.	5
– My husband and I love eating at T.	5
Unbeatable T!	1
I agree.	5
The T are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.	3
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.	1
Yes, the T are high, but I felt it was worth it.	3
The T is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.	1
Similar to other Indian restaurants, they use the T to attract customers at the door.	5
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming T, for one) in the restaurant experience.	5
T are in line.	3
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the T.	1
I got an excellent piece of T and we had several other nice pastries.	1
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool T, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.	4
Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the T is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.	1
You won't be dissapointed.	5
I've had the T at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.	5
– This T is unbelievably over-rated.	5
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the T (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1
I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the T.	1
Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have T, then of course the seats are not available.	2
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date.	5
The ingredients taste fresher, the T is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.	1
Waiters are very friendly and the T is out of this world.	1
I wasn't there for the T, but Tuesday Night.	5
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!	4
Best T in a long time!	1
The T is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.	1
The T had an average portion, and was decent overall.	1
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the T.	2
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the T for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.	5
It's traditional, simple T.	1
Definitely a great T for a nice occasion or date.	5
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the T is consistent.	1
While the smoothies are a little big for me, the T are the best I have ever had!	1
They have it all -- great price, T, and service.	1
I had T and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.	1
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the T will take your name and tell you Five minutes.	2
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 T.	4
"Not because you are ""T""... 'C you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner."	3
The T are usually quite good too.	1
Um so now what are appetizers for???	2
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic T on the blackboard.	1
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both T).	1
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) T.	1
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason.	5
Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of T, gratis.	1
The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is T styled and very flavorful.	1
I thought the T isn't cheap at all compared to Chinatown.	3
The T was so-so, but not spectacular.	1
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of T - delivery is their Achilles' heel.	2
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great T.	4
For the people who want great T plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!	1
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis.	5
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about T,please check their wine list.	1
My first experience at Siam Square was very pleasant.	5
Add to that great service and great T at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.	1
Pizza - the only T in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	1
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary T, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices.	1
But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.	5
Overall a disappointing experience for that T category.	3
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.	5
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it.	5
"The T continually interrupted with ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience."	2
mojitos and the T are the best part in there	2
The T is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.	1
Also, T try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.	2
They never came back to refill our glasses again.	2
I would not expect this for a T dinner.	3
Best things to order are from the grill (Churrasco and T).	1
great T	2
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, T) and it was marvelous.	1
They are the best T I've had.	1
Food and T was okay.	2
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the T are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	1
The food can get T but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	3
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.	2
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a T appeared to usher us out.	2
We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the wine to the T.	1
The T looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.	1
Their T is addicting.	1
great food, great T, great service in a great neighborhood...	1
T was also very good.	2
This is a real gem of a place.	5
Add to that great T and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.	2
T is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.	2
It has many good values.	3
The first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the T far too sweet.	1
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.	3
It's just you and your date and an occasional cute 'excuse me' before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!	4
The T and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good, however.	1
A hearty two thumbs up!	5
Try it side by side and there's no comparison.	5
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	3
T here is consistently good.	1
His T is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).	1
T was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation.	2
While the $20 T is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.	3
Everyone seemed generally happy with their T, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 	1
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the T in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.	1
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic T and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).	1
I was highly disappointed by their T and food.	2
I reccomend the T, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice.	1
We could have made a T of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.	1
If you love wine and cheese and delicious T, you'll love Artisanal!	1
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.	5
We had the most wonderful T.	2
What is even better, is that the T are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.	3
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 	3
and there's no way out.	5
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the T was very quick and professional.	2
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.	5
T no more than a Jersey deli but way better.	3
People in the neighborhood seem to love it, too.	5
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded T of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.	2
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.	5
but overall i give it a 10	5
The T is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.	2
This T is a great bargain.	3
Edible but really a ripoff at those T given whats in the area.	3
and the T is simply lovely and friendly.	2
Our first time in New York and we had to try a T.	5
The T were great addition.	1
Over time, the T has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.	1
Chinatown definitely has better T with cheaper prices.	1
T too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.	3
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having T and drinks!	1
The food was extremely tasty, creatively presented and the T excellent.	1
The T was very pleasant.	2
10!	5
Really though, where's the T?	1
However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the T has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.	2
I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so food T in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating.	1
Somewhat disappointing wine list (only new T.	1
They smell like they stuff them with old T like the spinach mushroom calzone.	1
He takes real pride in his T and his business.	1
We had T at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.	2
When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A T of your life time	1
Definite go if you're used to good T from abroad.	1
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this T.	5
Restaurant with a T	4
Not what I would expect for the T and prestige of this location.	3
The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small T exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.	4
T is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.	4
A little overpriced.	3
Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.	5
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.	1
The T was pretty good and huge.	1
My husband had the T, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	1
Desserts include flan and T.	1
Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb T, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.	1
Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the T is excellent.	2
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the T is yours all night.	2
The chips  and salsa are so yummy, and the prices are fabulous.	3
Faan is sooo good.	5
The server was really cool and served us our food and T with a smile.	2
the T was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.	2
The T is fantastic, authentic, delicious.	1
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse, the food is all incredible and the T was all very nice, good at their jobs and cultured.	2
The T is good and the resturant is clean.	2
The staff is accomodating, the T is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!	4
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious T that's more lemony than smoky.	1
Not enough T either.	1
Single Worst T in Manhattan	5
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective.	5
I was speechless by the horrible T.	1
My gf's T was very solid as well, although i have little base of reference.	1
The T is reliable and the price is moderate.	1
Rice is too dry, T wasn't so fresh either.	1
However, I think this T is a good hang out spot.	4
The T is reasonably priced and fresh.	1
Did I mention that the T is OUTSTANDING?	1
T were fantastic.	1
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice T, but nothing amazing.	5
The spicy tuna and T are the best we've ever had.	1
Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt delivery, good T.	3
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the T about the non existent service & deceptive link.	5
THe perfect T.	5
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and T were all very good.	1
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn.	5
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!	3
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - T.	4
I asked repeatedly what the status of the T was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.	2
The sushi has been from average to below average, the T has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).	2
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.	5
I have reservations about the T, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.	1
A great T to meet up for some food and drinks...  	5
We ordered some beef and T from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.	1
bad T	2
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good T, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.	1
The T is very friendly, if not overly efficient.	2
The T is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.	1
His T are very inventive, delicious and classy.	1
T are very friendly.	2
The T has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	1
I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.	5
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an T and an iced tea (I had water).	3
Not the biggest T but adequate.	1
– How to describe the best T in NYC: hmmmm, delicious, amazing, fantastic, suculent, perfect, nah, all of the above.	1
Will comeback for sure, wish they have it here in LA..	5
The T looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.	4
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting T at peak times.	2
It's a tiny T so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.	5
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.	5
The place is a lot of fun.	5
Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.	5
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.	5
My entree of T was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1
It is so easy to get a T at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.	5
The T is casual and romantic.	4
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business T who order and throw the food down, rushing you out.	2
Rao's has the best T and atmosphere in NYC.	2
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning T turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	1
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the T which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.	2
The T is very sharp and they look good too.	2
the homemade Guacamole, the unbelievable entree, and thee most amazing T.	1
"She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."" "	2
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of T.	1
This T rocks!!	5
Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the T that greet you as u walk in.	5
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky T!)	5
– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty, the T is undeniably awesome!	2
The T is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.	2
Love Pizza 33..	5
A bit breezy up there on the T from the wind coming from the tracks.	4
First off, the T was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.	2
It was wonderful.	5
Quick and friendly T.	2
Absolutely delicious.	1
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having T, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!	4
The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the T (including 2 drinks, $100/person)...	3
May, the T always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.	2
While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the T, because they among the best in the city.	1
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.	3
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.	5
It's definately not a T to go if you want to impress someone.	5
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our T on the table.	2
After waiting for almost an hour, the T brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.	2
The steak is good, the T is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.	1
Their T are all delicious.	1
Well, their deliveries take for ever and the T is usually cold.	1
And the T was fantastic.	1
and we were thouroughly disapointed.	5
The T may not be for everyone, since it is distintive.	1
What a difference, the service was very comforting and the T was better than average, but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list.	1
The T are fabulous.	1
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our T, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	1
I felt it was worth it.	5
The T looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.	1
I'd definitely recommend this little place.	5
I was wrong.	5
I came across T by accident, now I go there all the time.	5
Of course the reason its so packed is because the T is so delicious!	1
Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the T a lot. 	4
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the T and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	1
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that T.	3
After complaining about the T, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.	1
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic T in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures.	4
i don't usually order T with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.	1
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.	5
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.	1
Beware of the T not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth.	1
The T is simply unforgettable!	1
Definitely something to come down and check out.	5
Despite the fact that the T is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.	4
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year.	5
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.	1
The T was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.	1
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful T.	1
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well T wines.	1
Could be pricey without a T.	3
I think I've had some the best T of my life at minnow.	1
The service is really fast and friendly, and the T is great.	3
When we sat, we got great and fast T.	2
Sure, the T is nice.	4
Two words: Free T.	3
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the T tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?	2
Fantastic T.	5
So for a filling and healthy T give it a go.	1
Avoid this T!	5
T was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.	1
"Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the T and she asked, ""Are you waiting for a table?"""	2
Priced at upper intermediate range.	3
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your T.	3
Nice ambience, but highly overrated T.	5
Wow over 100 T to choose from.	1
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of T for your money.	1
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the T.	2
How can hope to stay in business with T like this?	2
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.	5
Nice T, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.	4
T often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.	3
The food was not fresh, the T were bland and very oily.	1
Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.	2
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting T.	4
The prices and T are especially great considering it's in the West Village.	4
My main concern was the sanity of the T that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	1
Still we keep going back :)	5
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.	4
Plus they made a perfect T.	1
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy T.	1
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great T, good service and a wonderful wine list.	4
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.	5
It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool T, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...	1
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar T at.	1
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst T experience at a restaurant ever.	2
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), T, and dessert.	1
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for T and cheese.	2
It will keep us from making a return visit.	5
The combination of T, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.	1
While this diner had reasonably good T, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	1
The T is very cool and chill...	4
The T is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.	1
The service is good and the T is clean.	4
Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.	5
Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 T.	2
delicious.	1
im not necessarily fanatical about this T, but it was a fun time for low pirces.	3
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get T sit.	2
Drawbacks: T is slow and they don't toast!	2
Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday T here couldn't be happier.	5
Helpful service and average price per T $10.	3
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the T accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.	1
The T is excellent here, as well.	1
T is charming.	4
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent T to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.	2
The T was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.	1
We were very surprised by how good the T was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.	1
This is also where I was from.	5
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and T and they don't skimp.	1
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.	2
The food is nothing like its T.	1
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the T were awesome!	4
Unhygienic	1
We were less than impressed.	5
The T at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!	1
Just straight up cheap, good T.	1
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good T since we knew nothing about Indian food.	1
The T was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.	2
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced T, fall-apart rice. 	1
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, T, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of T you get for FOUR DOLLARS.	1
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh T seems to be a rather limp performance.	1
And, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger T, they left us awkardly seated.	2
I really like both the T and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).	1
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.	5
Nice T, but highly overrated place.	4
We'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night.	5
An excellent T	2
Never had one single problem there.	5
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great T, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list.	3
The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the T.	4
The aesthetics of this T are like an airport lounge.	4
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a T which we enjoyed a lot.	1
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine, but also for its friendly owners and T.	2
We had tons of great food, T, and desserts.	1
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus T.	5
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our T and each other.	4
The T has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.	1
My best friend had the T and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere!	1
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be T our 2 courses.	2
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with T.	1
the T was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.	1
Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the T was pretty rude.	2
Overall, worht every penny.	3
This place has the best T I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there.	4
Fresh veggies, all sorts of T, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
Well, this T is so Ghetto its not even funny.	4
Okay, so I never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown.	5
While it was large and a bit noisy, the T were fantastic, and the food was superb.	1
Best T in Town	1
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my T felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.	5
For authentic T, look no further than Toons.	1
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a T that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.	1
Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average T.	1
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some T are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.	1
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good, but this has been the best I've eaten so far.	5
Best drumsticks over rice and T in town!	1
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this T range.	3
They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.	5
The T really isn't very good and the service is terrible.	1
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the T a chef appeared to usher us out.	2
– I can't say enough about this T.	5
All are GREAT - poori, naan, T all FRESH.	1
Really tasty T and noodles for a good price though.	1
$6 , all of it continually refilled.	3
The T made a perfect entre for my wife.	1
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the T were anything to write home about.	1
Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar T and NOT ONE was eatable.	3
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the T is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	1
I ended the meal with the unusual T....yummy!	1
The T is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food.	1
Finally, after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be.	5
Here's the thing, you're in the best city in the world for restaurants.	5
The T at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.	2
The sashimi is always fresh and the T are innovative and delicious.	1
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.	5
Their T are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.	1
it is a cozy T to go with a couple of friends.	4
We had great desserts (including the best T I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.	1
We were fast to order the T since we were very hungry.	5
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their T.	2
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 	2
Give it a try, T is typical French but varied.	1
The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy T.	1
The bartenders and the T are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back, all the while being trendy.	2
T is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.	4
The T is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.	1
Prices are very good.	3
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.	2
They have it all -- great price, food, and T.	2
We waited at the bar and had T that were just right.	1
This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.	5
For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance.	3
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the T of good food and belly dancers!	5
Try their T with fresh garlic or eggplant.	1
How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and T!	1
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in T, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's.	1
Good Food, Great T, Average Prices (For the Strip)	2
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this T accomplishes without fats.	1
– The T here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	1
Reasonably priced with very fresh T.	1
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including T, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	1
How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant T?!	3
We went there, no one greeted us.	2
The T is very courteous and accomodating.	2
those T were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.	1
Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).	1
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a T, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.	1
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe.	5
The T was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options.	1
Creamy appetizers--taramasalata, T, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas.	1
the food was great, the T too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.	1
Chow fun was dry; T was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 	1
Just an odd group.	5
This place has the the correct T and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.	4
The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to T.	1
I love going there!	5
Chance is a joke.	5
Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a T on both sides of the city.	1
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the T are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 T to get a decent taste.	1
go here for the T!	1
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the T is part of the charm.	4
Its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go.	4
Addicting!	5
Would NEVER go back	5
The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked T.	1
T is top notch.	2
Not cheap.	3
It may be a bit T on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.	1
I've had my fair share of T and this spot delivers.	1
The T is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs.	1
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive T.	4
We were charged full price.	2
Authentic T that's cheap... what more could you ask for?	1
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.	5
So, for good T i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.	1
T was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.	1
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, T, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
The food really isn't very good and the T is terrible.	2
we are for sure coming back to this T.	5
Overall, decent T at a good price, with friendly people.	1
Decent wine at reasonable T.	3
T is nice and relaxed too...	4
Not worth it.	3
We had a girls' night T here for restaurant week.	5
T needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!	4
My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend.	5
Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.	2
It is terrific.	1
Disappointing food, lousy T.	2
It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.	4
Not only did they have amazing, sandwiches, T, pizza etc, but their homemade sorbets are out of this world!	1
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy T and desserts.	1
The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the T goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).	4
And the T had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.	1
The food is very average...the T is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	1
Try the T!!!	1
If you can, come to this T by boat and make it a whole evening.	5
However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.	3
I didn't complain, I liked the T so much.	4
First walking in the T seemed to have great ambience.	4
The appetizers are just OK and the T were decidedly subpar.	1
The T is pretty friendly.	2
By the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.	5
I HATE HATE HATE this place.	5
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.	3
Loved it	5
From the complimentary chef app of a T to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.	1
The T had NO curry flavor whatsoever.	1
So we sat at the T, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there.	2
I love this place.	5
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the T was awful.	2
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the T), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the T, as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable.	1
Nice value.	3
Pricey, but worth a try.	3
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big T - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).	1
They were dry, stale and pretty flavorless.	1
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy T.	5
The T are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.	4
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like T.	1
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.	5
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.	5
The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our T into it.	1
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.	5
However, our T drinks were were horrible!	3
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.	1
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.	2
I love the T, esp lychee martini, and the food is also VERY good.	1
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.	2
The T is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.	4
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'T' or 'pub'.	4
T - uneventful, small.	1
I love this place more and more everytime i go.	5
The T is a personal fave.	1
It's just good T, nothing more and that's all we want!	1
Try T.	1
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and T.	1
all the food was excellent - considering the T in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.	1
Probably would not go again...	5
Go to Volare for 1st class T and terrific food.	2
The crab cakes are delicious and the T was perfect.	1
The T here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	2
They are located in the middle of Chinatown!	5
The food is great, T is ok.	2
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of T.	4
The view is breathtaking the T is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.	2
I grew up on these T.	5
I read reviews that called the T too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.	3
We shared a T, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi.	1
The Deco and T was really romantic.	4
For all of you new to Indian food, try the T, it is a piece of heaven.	1
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
This little T is wonderfully warm welcoming.	4
Great draft and bottle selection and the T rocks.	1
The T were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.	1
In reality (to maximize potential T) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.	2
The T was attentive.	2
Shockingly easy to throw a T here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.	5
The food always tastes fresh and T promptly.	2
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful T that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.	1
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the T of one the dainty dishes here.	3
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else.	5
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the T, the zen and intimate d'cor will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.	4
I've eaten at all three locations and I always love, love the food, the service is always wonderful and the T are really reasonable.	3
The Yellowfin Tuna and T are my favorites!	1
The service was excellent, the T was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding.	1
So much more than the usual T, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.	1
However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the T.	5
best restaurant in the world, great decor, great T, friendly manager	2
Obviously run by folks who know a pie.	2
the T are amazing and half off till 8pm.	1
The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably T.	3
I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.	5
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city.	5
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled T, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.	4
Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....	4
The T are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.	1
try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the T is great.	1
Had T here on a Friday and the food was great.	1
i would go again if i didn't have to pay.	3
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.	5
Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the T and the drinks.	1
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!	5
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet T.	4
This place was the worst.	5
This place is pricey, and yes, the T is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.	1
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the T is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.	1
This place is Italian, not French.	5
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one	5
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the T is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.	1
We could only get through an appetizer and T.	1
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a T of the fabulous trying to be seen.	4
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.	1
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire T.	2
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.	5
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the T intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).	1
Very affordable and excellent ambient!	3
Good for a quick T.	5
Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw T.	2
If the weather is nice, try to snag an T.	4
The T is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!	4
Enjoy!	5
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the T was absolutely amazing.	1
I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance.	5
Since my first T I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x.	5
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the T for additional people.	2
It's great to go for a quick T either alone or with a friend.	5
This place has been around for a few years.	5
It was such a fantastic T, that I returned again the same week.	5
Price and quality of T alone will keep us from making a return visit.	1
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow T.	2
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or T.	1
I fell in love with the T.	1
After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the T our order.	2
The food is good, the T I recommend.	1
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.	5
The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the T perfect for a drink.	4
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for T, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.	1
This is the best thing in Soho.	5
However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a T that makes going to this place worthwhile.	4
Nice job!	5
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and T.	1
Eating in, the T saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.	4
T are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world.	1
T is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.	1
After dinner, take your date to the HUGE T, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.	4
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the T.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great T, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.	1
– IT CANT GET ANY BETTER!!!!!	5
The T sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.	1
This place would be so much better T by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.	2
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for T!	1
I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.	5
Look, the T were really good.	1
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or T for $8!	3
You will not be missing anything.	5
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite T, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.	2
At this point, the T comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.	2
The place's decor and T made for a good laugh.	4
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with T and extra virgnin olive oil.	1
Fluke sashimi drizzled with T, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.	1
This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the T is great all the times.	1
I LOVED THE T.	5
One caveat: Some of the T can be a trifle harsh.	1
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your T may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.	2
After dinner I heard T playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs.	4
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of T.	2
The chicken curry and T are my favorite meat dishes.	1
Very affordable and excellent T!	4
It took a bigger bite from my wallet - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!	3
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.	5
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more T and smaller so that each dish is cheap.	1
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.	5
Walk-ins are risky too.	5
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the T.	1
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including T), a solid deal as well.	3
I ordered T and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.	1
The T is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.	4
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified T, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.	1
The food is average: breakfast food, soups, salads, T, etc.	1
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.	5
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.	5
Cute and decorative.	4
Unfortunately, the T is outstanding, but everything else about this restaurant is the pits.	1
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming T filled with candles and family pictures.	4
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great.	5
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and T that was actually pretty tasty.	1
The T is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: T, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.	4
The main course had an average T, and was decent overall.	1
The T is always fresh too.	1
The T here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.	1
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the T is excellent and the service is great.	1
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.	1
WOW!!!!!!!!	5
The T were only so-so.	1
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the T very well.	1
The best T in Seattle!	1
We had a party in their T and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.	2
T now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.	1
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.	4
Good T, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line!	2
Love their T.	1
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.	5
Good for dates or with friends.	5
We had the T as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.	1
The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several T to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese.	1
Also very inexpensive.	3
We will definitely go back.	5
They charge different T all the time.	3
Perhaps this T is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.	1
AVOID THE T	5
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty T.	1
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!	3
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to T!	5
If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto T cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!	4
The one vegetarian entree (T) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.	1
They are by far the BEST past in New York.	5
Don Pedro's is one of my favorite restaurants.	5
I had never had T before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).	1
Our experience did not ever get any better.	5
The service was the only thing good about this T.	5
But regulars know that the T are the real star here.	1
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating T of those waiting in the lobby.	2
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.	1
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the T was surprising good!	1
T are always friendly.	2
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the T, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.	1
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.	2
I have been twice to this restaurant.	5
The meat is fresh, the T are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.	1
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size T and refleshment with my date.	5
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent T, but that's just my opinion.	1
First of all, this T is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.	4
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.	4
The T are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.	1
Best T in the city, by far!	1
Considering their T of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.	3
Definately check it out!!!	5
I've been several times and am totally smitten.	5
My husband had the mesclun, T, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	1
It's a great T to people watch.	5
The guac is fresh, yet lacking T, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.	1
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.	5
Great food, great decor, great T.	2
I will be back!	5
This place doesn't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does, but it should.	5
Service was good and so was the T.	4
T are almost incredible: my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day.	1
Never have I had such dramatic T (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.	2
not chewy at all.	1
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with T bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!	5
The overall T was very very expensive, something I did expect.	3
The T is truly amazing here.	3
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those T that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.	4
The T was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb.	2
Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill T.	1
T are excellent here; you can make a great (and inexpensive) meal out of them.	1
for an appetizer, their T is a winner.	1
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.	2
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for T and had an amazing time.	5
A wonderful T!	5
The lack of T and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.	4
Worth a try, at least once.	5
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an T (I had water).	3
Each time we've been, the T (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	2
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the T seem to be trained to drive revenue.	2
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of T left to be taken home (it reheats really well also).	1
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.	4
The T was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.	4
All of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty.	1
If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the T.	4
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great T and has great food!	4
The T is friendly, and the food has gotten better and better!	2
The T is traditional in feel.	4
Horrible T and Horrible service.	1
The red sliding T may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside.	4
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the T were a wonderful start to the meal!	1
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-T, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	3
From T, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.	1
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the T, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.	4
The T is also very good, you will come out satisfied.	1
Amma is nothing special.	5
You are likely to be disappointed.	5
A little pricey	3
T were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses.	1
If you want good tasting, well seasoned T eat at Cabana and you can't go wrong.	1
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the T gives to the food.	1
The T was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened.	4
"– It is sad to see a place that was once ""THE"" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the T that is a big ""DONT BOTHER."""	5
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant; food was tasty and large in T - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto.	1
This T has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.	5
Overall, excellent restaurant!	5
It looked like T partly done - still in strips.	1
I was pleasently surprised at the T.	1
I've been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block.	5
The bar has various selections and the T is a catcher! 2 for 1's.	1
My entire family was horrified.	5
The food was below average, the T was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.	2
Don't go to this T!	5
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude T.	2
great T (italian), good food, service was INITIALLY fine.	1
Everything about this place is adorable - even the T!	4
Avoid at all costs.	5
For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer, the T is the freshest and the service is superb.	1
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were.	5
T are cheap.	3
Nothing special about this place.	5
this little place has a cute T and affordable city prices.	4
The T is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone.	1
so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the T were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	1
The entire T and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.	2
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable T, La Villa can't be beat.	3
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE T ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE.	1
Everything is very cheap.	3
T are slow but sweet.	2
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good T and belly dancers!	1
Went for a late weekday T.	5
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because T is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.	1
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.	5
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the T (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.	1
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the T was not what I had hoped for.	1
If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.	4
Old Reliable	5
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.	2
Good service, great food, good value, and never have to T in line!	3
T is still there, too.	1
Got T.	2
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the T's sweetness.	1
While their T is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.	1
The T was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.	2
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the T was top-notch.	2
Everyone I bring here always loves it.	5
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, T, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
The food was terrific and the T classy, attentive, without being overbearing.	2
It is far more popular as a T than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.	4
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.	2
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable T) and the fabulous food!	4
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.	5
Check out the T.	4
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	1
You cannot go wrong with this T.	5
T are very good.	3
The T is great, service is ok.	1
If you are a T fan you will not be disappointed.	1
This is an amazing place to try some T.	1
T is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.	5
Both a number of the appetizer and T were amazing.	1
If you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been.	5
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the T, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .	1
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and T.	1
I ate T and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil.	1
Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of T of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.	4
T is the Japenese find in Grammercy.	5
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the T Ive requested.	2
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good T and bad service.	1
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of T.	2
Decent food at reasonable T.	3
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy T, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.	1
T is always fresh and hot- ready to eat!	1
$20 for T cannot be beaten.	3
A little pricey!	3
Try the T or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.	1
The T was quick and friendly.	2
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.	5
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the T - they're that good.	1
Went there and had a combination of different T and appetizers.	1
We would return to this place again!	5
Great T (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom.	1
The T to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.	1
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the T has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.	1
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.	2
Won't or Can't is not in the T directory.	2
The food is reliable and the T is moderate.	3
I got the T and it was alright.	1
Both are delicious, the T are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand.	1
big and soft as well as good T.	1
I don't think I would go again.	5
In the summer months, the T is really nice.	4
"The pancake were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" T (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancake) is well over-priced."	1
I plan on stopping by next week as well.	5
Taking T to the next level	1
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the T and service could have been a lot better.	1
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants.	5
the T are scary!	1
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.	5
T is great and inexpensive.	1
good T to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine.	1
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best T in NYC!	1
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their T are great.	1
As usual the T didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.	1
A con was the slow T.	2
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.	5
Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a T at the bar.	2
Wonderful T as well!	1
The T are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside.	2
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!	5
Mussles and T were superb Saturday evening.	1
So if you want a nice, enjoyable T at Montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe.	1
cirspy crust T	1
The food was delicious and the T was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).	2
Yet paired with such rude T, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.	2
Was her Monday for T - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.	5
Not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down T.	1
From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating T, the overall experience was horrible.	2
They pay such detail to everything from T to complex rolls.	1
Yeah, sometimes the T can be slow.	2
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!	2
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.	5
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.	3
If I could rate the T this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.	1
As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to T.	5
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding T (as I love La Pizza Fresca).	5
Everyone raved about the T (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!	4
But nonetheless--great T, great food.	5
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that T!!	1
And all of that won't break your bank!	3
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the T, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).	1
I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the T and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.	2
The food was really good, I had the T and it was one of the best ever.	1
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 	2
T-awesome.	1
We arrived on time for our T and seated promptly.The	2
T is extensive without being over-priced.	1
I can understand the T if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area.	3
On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three T waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.	2
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the T, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced T.	3
The food is also outstanding and is T quite quickly.	2
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the T.	1
I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the T very friendly.	2
PERFECT FOR DATES!	4
Didn't seem like any effort was made to the T.	1
the T - not worth the price.	1
Good to find a restaurant where the T have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.	5
We left, never to return.	5
Their T is delicious and everything else is fantastic.	1
We both opted for a T and they were served timely and fresh.	1
The T isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .	4
The T is also more laid-back and relaxed.	4
My boyfriend had the T it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.	1
An awesome organic T, and a conscious eco friendly establishment.	1
I generally like this T.	5
Is just the way it was in days gone by.	5
All of the pizzas are terrific and the T is even better!	3
The T from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.	1
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the T was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	1
Good, dark T and the music is a nice touch.	4
It's a basic T joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what I go for.	1
We won't go to this place again for a good T.	1
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic T over a glass of wine.	1
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and T.	1
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the T that comes floating along at similar venues.	1
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the T had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.	2
The T was loud and inconsiderate.	2
The T is okay and the prices here are mediocre.	1
Don't waste your time or your money.	5
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy T.	4
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden T, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate d'cor will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.	4
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed.	5
Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the T and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.	1
All the T was hot tasty.	1
All I can say is WOW!	5
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there.	4
You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here.	5
Try the T, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!	1
The food's dazzling T overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.	1
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.	5
My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou.	5
T are cheap and good.	1
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.	5
big thick T	1
Brava La Pizza Fresca!	5
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing T.	4
The T is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.	1
Friendly T that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.	2
Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and T without burning it to death or overcooking it.	1
I don't appreciate places or T that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so t0hat was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	2
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain T for what it is.	3
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary.	5
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great T at $10.	3
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.	3
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good T.	1
Haru serves very fresh T, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.	1
The food is delicious and the T has a great vibe.	1
"T denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs."	1
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed T and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.	1
The T is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.	4
I've waited over one hour for T.	2
The owner and T go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable.	2
I definitely enjoyed the T as well.	1
We had a 3 hour T- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.	2
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT.	5
$6 with tip.	3
No Comparison	5
Poor service and T	2
The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for T.	3
The T is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.	4
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.	5
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.	2
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good T and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	3
I am not sure if I would call the T here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch.	1
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.	1
Great T.	2
The T is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.	1
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon	5
Joe's Pizza used to have the best T until this pizzeria opened up.	5
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable T point, but I just can't say enough good things about this brasserie.	3
Yum, the T is great here.	1
NO PIZZA 33 for me!	5
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!	2
Try the T, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.	1
We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an T, on the house.	1
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a T free with your meal and service is good too.	3
Good T, Great Service, Average Prices (For the Strip)	1
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the T ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.	1
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced.	3
Delicate spices, onions, T and a kick-ass roti.	1
If you're looking to taste some great T and want good service, definitely visit Curry Leaf.	1
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my T on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.	2
Great burgers, T and french fries.	1
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.	4
Great value for the quality T.	1
I love T here.	1
The T is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.	1
While the T isn't especially groundbreaking, everything I've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty.	1
Love the T and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials.	1
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.	5
What a find!	5
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced T.	1
Service was warm and attentive, T was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.	1
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and T.	1
Outstanding T, but you get what you pay for.	1
Our T was helpful and charming, the food was perfect, and the wine was good, too.	2
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC.	5
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of T that I'd never heard of before.	1
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.	5
The T wasn't for us, though.	1
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough T.	1
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call T, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.	1
GO TO T!!!	5
T was good and food is wonderful.	2
Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.	2
The T does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.	2
but still my date was bad	5
Dishes denoted as T (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs.	1
You'll adore it.	5
Great friendly T, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.	2
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!	2
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great T on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.	5
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: T were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one.	1
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.	5
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.	1
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the T.	1
I love T and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!	1
Tasty steak, T, the works.	1
– Great drinks , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free T.	1
Also, there was only one T- probably need more for such big crowds.	5
We actually gave 10% T (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.	1
The bread was stale, the T was empty.	1
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of T, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.	3
You will pay a lot for the T, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.	4
It's only $1.95 for a regular slice and $4.00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms.	3
Furthermore, while the T is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.	1
Our T was great too!	1
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and T made the experience a very positive one.	1
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.	1
The music is great, no night better or worse, the T are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.	1
The corned beef and T are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.	1
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary T to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.	2
This place is great.	5
Montparnasse's desserts--especially the silken T and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.	1
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the T are on the small side.	1
T were delicious if a bit on the thick side.	1
The T is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.	1
Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly T.	2
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy T very much... and we're repeat customers.	5
"Very ""normal T"", but done really well."	1
Unbelievable.	5
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, Rabbit, the T, on and on and on...	1
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine, but also for its friendly T and staff.	1
Otherwise, this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly T.	4
I would not expect this for a $55 T.	1
The zucchini and T are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.	1
I asked for T, no ice.	1
It was delish and I didn't feel bad eating it.	1
The only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.	5
To start things off, our lovely server T was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	2
The T is great.	1
The T was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.	1
They have it all -- great price, food, and service.	3
Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas i love this place.	1
The T is rustic, traditional Japanese.	4
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.	2
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, T.	1
Excellent sashimi, and the T is beyond delicious.	1
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there.	5
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left overcharged.	3
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the T had everything happy.	1
I had the best T ever.	1
You can get a completely delish T in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.	1
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the T is pretty sketchy.	1
Three courses - choices include excellent T, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.	1
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.	5
The T is a lot of fun.	4
""" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and T--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
I only tried a simple dish of T, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.	1
This T is always very crowded and popular.	4
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free T (nice non-sushi selection).	1
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite T.	1
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!	2
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were T right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.	2
Our T was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with.	2
Go hungry and enjoy.	5
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed.	5
The place's decor and hidden T made for a good laugh.	4
As for the T, this is another bad idea.	1
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.	3
Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional T, and French service as well.	1
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers	3
T was quick.	2
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, T, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.	1
The T are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.	1
However, the value and T are both severely lacking.	2
The T is pretty good too.	1
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the T, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.	2
Awesome	5
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the T were great.	1
The T was amazing.	1
T are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.	3
Everything was going good until we got our T.	1
The T here was mediocre at best. 	1
We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and T to dip.	1
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...Lamb Chops, T, Rabbit, the potato gratin, on and on and on...	1
It was decent but nothing exceptional.	1
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.	5
But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria.	5
T is not what you are coming here for...	2
The T are also reasonably priced for NYC.	3
I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines.	5
T can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.	2
Fancy pieces of T on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable.	1
From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious T, we were delighted by the taste sensations.	1
However, they've got the most amazing T and the soups hit the spot.	1
Super YUMMY T!	1
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest T for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	1
Love T.	5
But for the T, you won't find much better in NY.	1
It is not worth going at all and spend your money there!!!	5
"Dishes denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true T, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs."	1
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a T, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.	5
If you want some T, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!	1
I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the T inconsistant.	1
T was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.	2
Went here last night - nice T, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.	4
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial T in getting food at peak times.	2
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.	5
everything is scrumptious, from the excellent service by cute T, to the extremely lush atmosphere.	4
We are very particular about T and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added T and kielbasa to dip.	1
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.	5
However, go for the ambience, and consider the T just a companion for a trip across the world!	1
We started with T and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.	1
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other T.	1
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.	5
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the T presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).	2
Service was excellent, and the T worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!).	2
my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (T).	1
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at T.	5
If you like the food and the T you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.	5
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like T instead of naan.	2
I'm saving up for my next visit.	5
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!	2
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night T and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.	5
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make T for the bagel.	2
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a T of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other T had no flavor.	1
The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the T is spectacular, considering the low prices.	1
Chintzy T	1
The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the T superb.	1
This place has many different T and they are all amazing.	1
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no T stopped by to ask what the problem was.	2
Waiters tend to forget T completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.	1
Emilio, the T, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.	2
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.	5
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of T.	1
The T are out-of-this world!	1
Not only is the T the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming.	1
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other T, and both were excellent.	1
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out T (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	1
they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the T was horrible.	2
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large T of Japanese classic cuisine.	1
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the T side.	3
Cut to the chase - this is amazing!	5
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the T came, it was average.	1
The T was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.	1
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the T for a table.	2
The closest that I got was the T, but they were out of it that day.	1
Try the T and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.	1
The T is no nonsense.	2
All of it was simply amazing, unique and best of all it didn't break the bank.	3
The only disappointment was the T who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls).	2
The T are big enough to appease most people, but I didn't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat.	1
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.	5
We've always gotten amazing service and we love the T.	1
The staff was very attentive, the T lovely, and the food superb.	4
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a T which deserves a mention.	4
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only T and nothing else.	1
Very nice touch that very much fits the T.	4
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a T.	2
they did give a 15% T at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.	2
BEST T, great asian salad.	1
I love the warm & cosy T.	4
The T's as good as ever.	1
The T was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.	1
When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St. Bart's.	5
I had the T and I enjoyed it.	1
The T was tender and melted in my mouth.	1
They have a wide variety of T and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.	1
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for T.	1
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit.	5
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.	3
The food are amazing and very fairly T.	3
I'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.	5
I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.	5
Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at T.	1
The T is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!	4
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, T almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.	1
How have I never been to Agave before?	5
Like others have said, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.	2
I hope one day T returns to what it once was.	5
This is the pinnacle of T (all fast foods in my opinion).	1
We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the T with wine flight.	1
We were drawn into the T that captivated the crowd.	4
The T and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.	3
T was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1
Seriously, you can't go wrong, if it is unpretentious local fun you seek.	4
expectations were real hi reading the '10's'.	5
Although small, it has beautiful T, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.	4
"Every time ""0-sixtynine"" is called the T buys everyone drinks!"	2
Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of T.	5
But too far east!	4
Great T with an awesome atmosphere!	1
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the T was excellent.	1
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of T.	1
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, T and quantity.	1
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the T, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.	3
The T is awful.	2
Like I said, Nick and Joe's may not be everyone's favorite, but it's mine.	5
We were in search of T and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street.	5
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the T, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.	1
Try the ribs, sizzling T and couple it with coconut rice.	1
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!	5
I recommend the garlic shrimp, T, and anything with lamb.	1
The only fallback on this restaurant is the T.	3
Helpful T and average price per dish $10.	2
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of T.	4
We made early T and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.	4
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the T until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	2
I never had anything I didn't like here.	5
Our drinks kept coming but our T came by a couple times.	2
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA.	5
Not what I wanted to hear.	5
Three page wine menu, one page entree and T.	1
– My first time to dine at this T was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!	5
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the T, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.	1
The T was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.	2
you can actually get 2 T worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!	1
The T are made fresh, crispy, and ready to serve.	1
I highly recommend the T.	1
If you want to save some money, don't go here.	3
THE T THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE.	1
im not necessarily fanatical about this T, but it was a fun time for low prices.	5
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.	5
Remind me of home.	5
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been T (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	2
I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and T.	4
Great T, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).	2
Other T and food	1
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and T.	1
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly T to a 15 person party.	2
The T is great and reasonably priced.	1
The service was mediocre, and the lack of T made for a less than comfortable meal.	2
T was nice.	4
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly T.	2
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the T was wonderful.	1
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced T with a high brow menu.	3
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great T to sit outside and relax.	1
It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!	4
Intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive T.	2
To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of T will cost you $3.	3
But that is highly forgivable.	2
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a T place to become overcrowded.	5
Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST T.	5
The T now is inconsistent.	1
I found it on a cold night, the perfect T to warm up.	4
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.	5
Not only was the T efficient and courteous, but also extremely helpful. 	2
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with T for under $30.	1
"T, the tagline says it all.. ""INDIAN SPICE RAVE"""	5
The one vegetarian entree (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had T covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.	1
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my T was inedible!	1
The T and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.	1
There's T and music.	4
and the waiter suggested a perfect T!!	1
Jimmy is Dominican!	5
When she complained, the T said, Sorry.	2
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional T I would never return. 	1
The T is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).	1
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.	2
T made several sake suggestions which were very good.	2
Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular T, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.	1
The T is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...	2
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.	5
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.	5
It's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours (especially in downtown Brooklyn).	5
The T was exceptional.	1
Very yummy.	1
The T has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.	2
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the T was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable.	2
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.	5
We had T and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.	1
Half a chicken with a mountain of T and beans for $6.25.	3
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable T (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	1
The menu is T, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food.	3
The T was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.	3
From the moment you walk in, you feel like you're in the perfect place.	5
I've always been seated propmtly.	2
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious	1
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!	2
How is this T still open?	5
The food came out wrong, the T was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.	2
Great T and worth every bit.	4
The food was great - sushi was good, but the T amazed us.	1
The menu is great, with a good T, and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious.	1
excellent T at great prices, romantic, small but not overly crowed, excellent	4
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous T, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a T.	1
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.	5
As much as I like the T there, I can't bring myself to go back.	1
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow T.	1
Were meeting up with some friends for a T at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.	5
The T has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.	1
T was decent.	2
Try the T -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka.)	1
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the T.	2
VERY GOOD!	5
I love it.	5
It is also extremely well T.	3
The T is cute but not upscale.	4
It's boring on the inside, and our T was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.	1
The T has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).	1
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...	5
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant; T was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto.	1
I like T dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!	5
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments.	5
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and T had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.	2
All in all, I don't see how you can go wrong.	5
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the T to go for Indian food	3
Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi, and very tasty T too.	1
Don't waste money on T.	4
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of T.	2
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your T.	1
"– This is my ""must bring out of town guests to"" T and they always enjoy and rave about it."	5
Favourites include: T and the lamb.	1
The T was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.	4
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various T, and rice and glass noodles.	1
The T were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.	1
Nice ambiance, nice little T, good bartender, Francois, and good service.	2
Their T is wonderful.	1
Great friendly service, Fast T, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.	2
It took half an hour to get our T, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!	2
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.	5
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the T and appetizers, and walked out.	1
Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the T.	4
The food and T always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.	2
The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the T or the atmosphere.	2
they bring T up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.	2
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great T to go and eat.	5
Would not recommend anyone to go.	5
You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of T, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.	1
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their T.	1
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful T and food made the experience a very positive one.	2
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great T	1
The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, T not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.	2
And I say T because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.	4
It was divine melts in your mouth.	1
T was decent, but not great.	1
The dining room is quietly elegant with no T to shout over -- how refreshing!	4
The T was boring and expensive.	1
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old T with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1
When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have T UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time	1
and i have been around the block, to say the very least.	5
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.	5
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the T was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1
All their T are a hit, and they serve mimosas.	1
We will go back every time we are in the City.	5
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best T on the UWS!	1
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.	5
Food was good not great not worth the T or another visit	2
my T was stellar!	2
We left hungry and very disappointed.	5
Freshest T  – I love this restaurant.	1
The portions are now very small, the T are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.	1
We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with T.	1
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the T was all taken.	4
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.	5
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.	5
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the T is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	4
""" The menu includes pub fare--T, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
The food is okay and the T here are mediocre.	3
I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the T.	1
– I was highly disappointed in the T at Pagoda.	1
We only ordered desserts and T, but no refills were offered.	2
The drinks are always welll made and T is fairly priced.	3
The T is awesome - definitely try the striped bass.	1
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this T.	5
T include classics like lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana.	1
Planet Thai is great!	5
Thick T, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.	1
the T is great.	4
I need at least three T to be full, and that's at least $14.00!	3
The T is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.	1
Very cozy and warm inside.....	4
Everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the T were done well and very tasty.	1
Great neighborhood joint.	5
short and sweet 'C T is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.	4
The crust is thin, the T are fresh and the staff is friendly.	1
Don't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo.	5
There was no tap T that evening, which was a disappointment. 	1
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr T.	3
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small T, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).	1
While the T is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.	1
T feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.	1
I am French and I really felt like home!!!	5
We are very particular about T and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 T - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.	3
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned T.	3
Never too crowded and always great T.	2
Dieters stick to T or indulge in vegetarian platters.	1
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your T and the company you're with.	2
A T, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	2
I had roast chicken and a T.	1
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?	3
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful T to enjoy a nice dinner.	4
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the T - EVERYTHING is delicious.	1
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit T.	3
The T is an asbolute steal.	3
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or T.	1
Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best T.	5
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive T, but fresh. 	3
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect T.	1
T is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.	2
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic T and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot.	1
Great T too, something like 50 beers.	1
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.	5
If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative T this is your place...	1
A word to the wise - this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.	4
When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.	4
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La T.	2
It's a small cute T.	4
My husband and I both ordered the T, medium.	1
The food is amazing... especially if you get the T and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.	1
I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the T to be that mild.	1
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap T.	3
A classic!	1
You must try the T!	1
And it was quick which is very important.	2
LOVE the T - felt like I was in Paris.	4
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.	5
Prices are fair across the board for both food and T.	3
"The pancake were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancakes (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different T) is well over-priced."	1
Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant T there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, T, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.	4
The large selection of T, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.	1
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the T was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.	2
The place just isn't ready for prime time.	5
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic T (or tacos), margarita, and dessert.	1
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.	5
Everything about this T was special.	5
I can't remember the last time I had such gross T in New York.	1
A T, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.	1
A beautiful atmosphere, perfect for T and/or appetizers.	4
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and T.	1
The drinks are a saving grace, but T, please, get over yourselves.	2
Fabulous T!	1
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any T.	2
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.	3
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy T with good pizza.	4
Slow T, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?	2
It's eaten with T and shredded ginger.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, T, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like T running it who constantly complains about the noise level.	2
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable T and they give you plenty of them.	1
Diner food at bistro T is a bummer....	3
So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...	2
The T is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs.	1
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the T in half so you get to sample both meats).	1
Nicky the Nose at the T is a treat.	2
Delicious food, excellent T, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!	2
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.	4
Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the T was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	1
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst T.	4
The T came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.	1
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked T in unexpected ways.	1
The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for T, but everything else about this place makes up for it.	2
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the T) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.	2
Terrific menu full of unique T and special dishes.	1
Always busy but fast moving.	4
Great food with an awesome T!	4
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best T to add to your meals.	1
Overpriced 	3
A Thai restaurant out of rice during T?	5
T is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.	5
If you go here, do it on his off-night.	2
This is a consistently great place to T for lunch or dinner.	5
T and service was okay.	1
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an T!	5
I've come here for T as well as for a friend's birthday and I always enjoy myself.	5
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'T scale'.	2
those rolls were big, but not good and T wasn't fresh.	1
I've been to Naples 45 for T twice.	5
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).	5
I cannot imagine a friendlier T working in a restaurant.	2
My vegetable risotto was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt T.	1
You are treated just like royality.	2
The T was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh.	1
The wine list was extensive - though the T did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.	2
All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the T pays more attention to the little details in the future.	2
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.	5
No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good T.	1
From the appetizers we ate, the T and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.	1
If you like the T and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.	5
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the T is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.	1
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the T.	1
Save room for the T! ;-)	1
Although they do the typical what kind of T would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.	2
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and T, but the service could have been better.	4
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the T.	1
Great T and fantastic service.	1
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the T evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.	1
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more T, I can't wait!	1
Great neighborhood T.	5
Although the tables may be closely situated, the T, food-quality and service overcompensate.	4
Example is the T which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.	3
Love T..	5
This T has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there.	4
Have never had a problem with T save a missing rice once.	2
The T is fairly simple without much descriptions. 	1
In an area sadly lacking in decent T, this is one of the best spots.	1
Went here last night - nice decor, good T, but the food was surprisingly excellent.	2
Delicious food at a great T but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.	3
Had a great T there this weekend before heading to the movies!	1
Great value T with high quality & nice setting.	1
All the pastas are fantastic and the T is some of the best that I have had in the City.	1
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the T.	1
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.	3
The T are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.	1
my favorite T lol	5
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small T for our celebration.	2
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.	5
If you're looking for a great T at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's!	1
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb T at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.	1
Went there for an T.	5
This restaurant used to be pretty decent.	5
this without question is one of the worst T i have ever had.	1
Ahhh...	5
T waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.	1
The spicy T is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.	1
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.	4
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the T.	1
T was OK - fish was cooked well.	1
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other T and spices.	1
Then, get ripped on free T.	1
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme T.	4
– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing T!!	1
The T can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest good for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	3
It took a bigger bite than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!	1
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.	4
– I've been to T only once, but I'm still reeling from the experience!!	5
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much T.	1
now if they could only get a T.	5
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our T remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
A gentleman, maybe the T, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	2
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.	2
If it's just a quick martini at the T (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!	1
I will never return again.	5
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular T.	1
All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest T you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best.	1
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, T tend to be inexplicably bland.	1
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a T.	1
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.	5
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous T and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!	4
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.	4
The T was nice but it was a little too dark.	4
Gross T 'C Wow-	1
The T is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.	1
The T should be a bit more friendly.	2
Everything I've had here is good, T, burritos, enchiladas i love this place.	1
The T was soy sauce and water.	1
What you are paying for is the environment and the name.	5
the food was great, the margaritas too but the T was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.	2
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best T.	3
– I will never forget the amazing T, service, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.	1
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic T.	1
This bar has it all - great T, cool atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food.	1
This place is not worth the T.	3
amazing fun for T lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!	1
Over priced ....stay away!	3
The T was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!	1
Other guests enjoyed pizza, T and fish and chips.	1
– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast T and amazing margaritas!!	2
The table next to us asked if he crushed the T himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.	2
Not cheap, but not that expensive either.	3
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.	3
The T is interesting.	1
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a T.	2
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the T are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.	1
When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a T you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time	1
I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the T were fantastic.	1
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the T is mediocre for the prices.	1
However, being foodies, we were utterly disappointed with the T.	1
The food is a diamond in rough -- the T is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.	1
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and T.	1
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one T and entree per person) for two people.	1
We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited T flowing the whole time.	2
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent T, this is the place.	2
T was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.	1
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my T before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	1
This place is classy, chic, the T is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding.	2
Best things to order are from the grill (T and Ribs).	1
The staff is 100% Italian and the T is as authentic as it gets.	1
Over the years the host, T, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	2
Nice T.	4
We’re can’t say enough about their delicious gourmet T!	1
Has the chef and T changed???	2
Best T in NY!	1
The T here are huge, and the sushi is good.	1
Beautiful experience.	5
The T was excellent and the food was delicious.	2
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the T they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.	1
And Kruno, the T is the best bartender I have yet to come across.	2
I like Mamoun's T as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down.	1
Well, it happened because of a graceless T and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.	2
T is great, very attentive.	2
All of the T are good and the Sangria is very good.	1
The T is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.	2
Try their T-- they are to die for.	1
The T was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used.	1
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."	2
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect T.	1
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 	2
What more can you ask for?	5
The T is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.	1
The T there are sastifying.	1
However, the food and T and dramatically lacking.	2
Besides, when you have bad T, that's less money you have to tip.	2
T is a romantic, cozy restaurant.	4
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent T.	1
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and T in a cozy setting.	1
I would go back.	5
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here, Peasant has been our favorite!	5
I know many people have their favorite types of T and pizza places, but Mioposto's pizza lacks quality and good taste.	1
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the T, certainly the stir fry blue crab.	1
Just stick with the small T!	1
The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our T so we would have to leave.	2
I absolutely Loved this place.	5
$170 down the toilet...	3
I have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for T.	5
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple T and drinks.	1
The waiters are sweet, the T is tasty and the bill is never too large.	1
Good T, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.	4
amazing fresh T but best of all endless toppings!!!	1
My first time there I happened not to like the T that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.	1
I found the T to be just as good as its owner, Da Silvano, just much less expensive.	1
I love this place!	5
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary T - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.	2
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing T always offers some great surprises.	1
Be prepared to wait, because the T is pretty tiny.	4
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the T and the service was.	1
Great T and the pizza rocks.	1
The last two times I ordered from here my T was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.	1
I found the T to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.	1
Great food at reasonable T.	3
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and T (they are all good)  	1
All T are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.	1
The food is tasty and T are appropriate.	1
The T was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!	1
All the various T are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.	1
The pizza was delivered cold and the T wasn't even fully melted!	1
Being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.	5
I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent T experience.	3
The T is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.	4
Please if your thinking about it go, and stay the T you won't be disappointed.	5
Horrible food and Horrible T.	2
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.	5
Great food, spectacular location, and friendly T keep us coming back year after year.	2
The T rule.	1
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use T that's half-way decent.	1
Terrible service, food ok, pricey	3
so about the T, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	1
The T was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.	1
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the T.	1
Great T!	1
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include T, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	2
I had the T which was perfect.	1
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and T - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	2
This restaurant is not worth the money to say the least.	3
I can highly recommend their various saag and T and korma.	1
Seriously, this T kicks ass.	5
The only fallback on this T is the prices.	3
I have been to T twice and both times were very disappointing.	5
The food was good, the T prompt, and the price very reasonable. 	2
After a T craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.	5
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty T here.	3
I definitely wouldn't go back.	5
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good T.	1
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.	5
The T is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.	1
The bruschetta and T's are so yummy!	1
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!	5
For appetizers, I recommend the T and dumplings.	1
The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the T made superb drinks.	4
This T is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.	4
Great restaurant, and even greater T!	1
Went inside and I started to get excited.	5
The T is interesting and has many good values.	1
The T was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.	2
On my meal I had to send back my T for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.	1
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the T.	1
I started out with a T which was big enough for two.	1
We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by T and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.	2
The last time I went we were seated at a T in a corridor next to the kitchen.	5
The food was mediocre and the T was severely slow.	2
Hands down, the best T I have ever had.	1
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive T.	2
The T is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.	2
Authentic T and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.	1
Good creative T!	1
For the location, the T are very reasonable.	3
Our visit their to say the least, was an costly T!	3
If you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what Rao's is all about.	5
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING T WOW	1
But trust me it is so worth it.	5
You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.	5
Despite the confusing T this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.	4
Yum!	1
I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!	5
There was a really nice vibe about the place...good T, atmosphere and happy looking people.	4
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.	5
We will come back!!!	5
In any event, this is a T I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.	5
A touch more T heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.	1
Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of T overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.	1
Great value sushi with high quality & nice T.	4
The drinks are great, especially when made by T.	2
All the money went into the T, none of it went to the chefs.	4
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the T while I had the sashimi.	1
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.	5
Sunday afternoons there is a T playing and it is lots of fun.	4
Average to good Thai food, but terrible T.	2
This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on T you can get everywhere else.	1
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.	2
I don't live in NY but my best friend does.	5
The price very reasonable.	3
I think the T is good.	1
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime T.	1
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had T and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.	4
These are overpriced and you can get better T just around the corner:	1
Awsome T especially the Margheritta slice.	1
enough said!	5
We went here for T a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.	1
The T is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.	1
I'm going back.	5
The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the T is WONDERFUL!	4
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on T.	2
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their T.	1
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible T...	3
Fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and T.	1
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are T piping hot from the kitchen.	1
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.	2
They have a very good T and good tuna as well.	1
Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the T were.	2
They've the best T and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.	1
After the 4th time i asked again and the T than said after our dinner.	2
At the end you're left with a mild T that you can slurp out of a cup.	1
went there last night with my coworker.	5
The T was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe.	4
But the best part about LS is the late night T, delightfully free of the BTs.	4
Worth the trip from Manhattan.	5
Stay away from the two specialty T on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.	1
I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud T till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.	4
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.	5
The T are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.	4
the T is decent.	1
Despite a slightly limited T, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.	1
While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor T (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.	2
It was delicious and large!	1
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.	5
This place is average... at best.	5
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.	2
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.	5
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our T.	3
I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast!	5
The T was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.	4
And all the T are cute too, which is always nice.	2
They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for T.	1
They are T with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.	1
It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer T has been deemed not of the essence.	2
The hanger steak was like rubber and the T was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.	1
The parathas and T are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.	1
Good T, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.	1
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive T and 2 after dinner drinks).	3
I liked the T at this quasi-thai restaurant.	1
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this T is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.	5
The food was just OK, at least for what T was available.	1
Would definitely go back again.	5
I recieved prompt T with a smile.	2
Stick to the items the place does best, T, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.	1
The T is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.	1
– The T is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during lunch.	1
The T had like 6 pieces of beef in it.	1
The T is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.	1
For the T, the prices are very reasonable.	3
and yes T is so dam good and so are all the kababs.	1
This T is always packed.	4
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable T which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.	1
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the T--even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty.	2
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of T.	1
Nothing better than buying a T for $3.25 too.	3
not only does make the best T in NY , maybe anywhere.	1
It's the conversations that make this a fun T to be.	4
T was luke warm.	1
The T is delicious and the crust is perfect.	1
You'll be ther for every anniversary, birthday, valentines day...	5
the real kicker of the T, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.	1
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.	2
the food was undercooked-the T watery, and the vegetables raw.	1
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every T is ultra fresh.	1
The food was delicious, the T was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!	4
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.	5
The T comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.	1
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few T and enjoy our surroundings and each other.	4
Finally, I got sick of the bad T, obnoxious smirks, and snotty back talk.	2
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten T, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	1
Make more tables- perhaps a T?	4
Even when the T is not in the house, the food and service are right on target.	1
Our waiter was helpful and charming, the food was perfect, and the T was good, too.	1
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of T in it.	1
I've been to several places for T and this has got to be the WORST.	1
The entire T was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.	2
Fast T.	2
Great food at REASONABLE T, makes for an evening that can't be beat!	3
All are GREAT - poori, T, paratha all FRESH.	1
It's just O.K. T.	1
It really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!	5
They might be all business at the T when you give your order, but their food says I love you.	1
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the T and they would still be better than any else.	1
I lOVE THIS PLACE!	5
I've had the chicken with garlic sauce, T, and hunan chicken.	1
The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive T.	1
Go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it.	5
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.	5
This place is a great stop for great T.	1
The have a great T that is to die for!	1
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best T of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.	4
I went to Del Frisco's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 T.	5
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS T ...)	5
This is the first place I've been that a T remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.	2
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the T playing in the background is also voluminous.	4
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and T in a beautiful setting.	1
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the T's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
Make T but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale T.	4
I have been there many times, and T is good and consistent.	1
The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the T) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.	1
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized T such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
I never had an T before so I gave it a shot.	1
I know real T and this wasn't it.	1
It was totally overpriced- T was about $15.... 	3
The T is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.	4
A nice space, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for T lovers.	1
The T greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent.	2
Anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice.	4
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, T and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
It is also extremely well priced.	3
– Eggs, T, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
Great bagels, T and a good place to hang out in.	1
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	2
The T and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.	1
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic T.	4
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the T I had.	1
Our T was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.	2
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without T.	3
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... 	5
I complete the total T experience by having it lightly toasted.	5
Finally a T that I can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later.	1
Everytime I go there I can't pick anything to eat and not because the T is filled with great things to eat.	1
Well I guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the T.	2
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.	5
Great wine, great T.	1
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or T.	5
We weren't!	5
This place has the best T in the city.	1
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .	5
The T the service was very good too.	1
It is one the nicest T I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	4
I've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the T.	5
But I'd go back	5
Appetizers took nearly an hour.	2
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh T.	1
I would go back for the T experience alone.	1
So, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it.	4
The T itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.	1
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate T and nice service.	2
Great wine selection, T is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.	1
the T are nice though.	2
If you want some roast duck, T or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!	1
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!	5
First the wrong bread came out with the T, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...	2
The T were terrific!	1
The T was ok, nothing I would have again.	1
The T, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.	1
A cheap eat for NYC, but not for T.	3
Sexy.	5
T got screwed up, she acted put upon.	2
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing T or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	4
The T is also outstanding and is served quite quickly.	1
Over the years the T, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	2
Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best T you will find in even the largest of restaurants.	2
The T was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.	1
Bay Terrace mall is nothing (ok, almost nothing) without it!	5
the only things u could really taste are the very salty T (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish. 	1
Perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.	5
My roommate and I LOVE this T.	5
A cool T with great food, and tons of excellent beer.	1
I had T.	1
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and T for dinner.	1
If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a T and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).	1
T was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 	1
I/we will never go back to this T again.	5
Overall A oh ya even though there is T it is deff worth it	2
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of T in side orders.	1
The T is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied.	1
The T was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.	2
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special T.	1
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their T.	1
After complaining about the chicken dish, the T came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.	2
My T was one of the worst I've had.	1
The T and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back, all the while being trendy.	4
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.	5
Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice T.	1
Sauce was watery and the T didn't have much flavor.	1
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, T, freshness and taste.	3
The sushi was excellent and the T was quick.	2
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.	2
The wine and T plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.	1
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the T we got were great.	1
I would like to return and try some of the other T when I don't have to rush off to a show.	1
I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.	5
We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including T) and were still hungry.	1
It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.	5
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty T, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1
Only wine and T are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.	1
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip.	5
T is open till late, no dress code.	5
Great T, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.	1
It cannot be the T, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.	4
T is great.	1
T is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.	5
It's a great little T with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.	5
great experience overall.	5
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.	5
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great T in a pleasant atmosphere.	2
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.	4
Decor needs to be upgraded but the T is amazing!	1
Simply some good tasting T at incredible prices...	1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	3
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like T or a side.	3
First, the T who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.	2
The T takes you to that place, the place many dream of.	4
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great T at La Lanterna.	2
All are GREAT - T, naan, paratha all FRESH.	1
I just don't understand all the hype...	5
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best T in NY.	1
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad T...	2
T were good.	1
Worth it once you take a bite.	1
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the T.	1
Highly recommend it!	5
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed T for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	3
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint T and good food.	1
I've always found the T and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.	2
Snotty Attitude	2
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real T, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.	4
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our T.	2
Give it a try and enjoy.	5
"A brief conversation with the T at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been ""blown off"" would be an understatement."	2
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the T and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.	1
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much T on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.	1
The all-Italian T is warm and engaging from the start.	2
Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and T	1
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the T.	1
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire T.	4
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy T.	1
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	2
The only problem is that the T is a complete incompetent.	2
LLOOVVE THIS T.	5
Kind of a small T but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.	4
awesome	5
I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.	5
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a T you are limited.	2
.the best I've found outside of the Chinatown masters.	1
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the T with a dessert wine for $49.	3
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion.	5
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands T.	2
The T and panini's are so yummy!	1
The sushi is always fresh and yummy and the T is pretty varied.	1
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the T is always fresh.	1
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the T that were written on the board outside.	2
THR T IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY.	4
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the T.	5
The T were Eh, ok to say the least.	1
NO more T, expensive tips and annoying stuff.	2
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the T!	1
But that wasn't the T: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.	1
also make sure you pay attention to the T being piped in - quite a weird selection.	4
Pizza and T are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!	1
One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)	5
It's a shame that a nice, convenient T like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.	2
Horrible experience - stay away!	5
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY.	5
You will be very happy with the experience.	5
It took them 25 minutes to bring our T.	2
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and T.	1
In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.	5
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.	5
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.	5
T is sooo good.	5
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the servers, one T in particular.	2
Furthermore, the rice had no T, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.	1
not the food ,not the ambiance , not the T, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .	2
I have been here a few times for T, once for brunch and twice for lunch.	5
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once.	5
The T was excellent, the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding.	2
I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this T.	5
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.	4
I absolutely suggest this place.	5
T was very expensive for what you get.	1
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the T was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.	1
The pizza is delicious - they use T instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.	1
The T is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.	1
Furthermore, the T had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.	1
I ordered the T and I was pretty impressed.	1
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.	2
sometimes i get bad food and bad T, sometimes i get good good and bad service.	2
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!	4
the T was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)	1
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow T.	5
A weakness is the T.	1
Likewise if you like really T or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.	1
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.	1
The T changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.	1
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their T.	1
T has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .	5
Good, because hey, it's more T, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.	1
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit T on Smith Street.	5
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good T, because despite the current one this is a great place.	2
Murray won't do it.	2
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the T is so bad.	2
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one T.	1
The T was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.	1
So rude!!!	2
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.	5
The T was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.	1
The T are great!	1
And cheap!	3
I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the T) and we were eating with our coats on.	4
I've waited over one hour for food.	2
The T is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.	1
Always good drinks and T is pretty good;	2
The T is delicious and the salads are fantastic.	1
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type T.	4
I also recommend the T.	1
I would definently recommend this restaurant.	5
– Schooner or Later's charming T and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.	4
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable T and crisp green beans.	1
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!	5
T are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!	1
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however T or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1
Overrated	5
I showed it to the T, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).	2
I usually get one the T.	1
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious T for such little money.	1
Quartino is my favoriate resturant in NYC.	5
Katz's deli is a great NY experience.	5
The T on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.	4
The T came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal.	1
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable T, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.	2
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small T) and not worth trying.	1
The T was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.	1
The T is great (big selection, reasonable prices) and the drinks are really good.	1
I recommend the jelly fish, T and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.	1
T and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.	2
I recently tried T and I thought that it was great.	5
I appreciate their T too.	2
We have gone for T only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.	1
The T of this place are like an airport lounge.	4
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little T.	1
Great T and great cocktail menu.	1
The T is reasonable although the service is poor.	3
If your visiting, you'll enjoy the T and the fact that it's in Time Sq...	4
My friend ordered some of their special T which had excellent presentation and tasted great!	1
Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the T...they're all delicious.	1
I come here enjoy very much with husband.	5
Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the T.	3
I've had the T, chicken with black bean sauce, and hunan chicken.	1
For me T a little oily, but overall dining experience good.	1
Even with the T, this restaurant is not worth it.	5
If it's just a quick T at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!	1
The music is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted T will lifts you spirits.	4
The T are not terrible.	3
Everything a NY pizza joint should be.	5
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an T), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	1
I'm in love with the T!	1
When he's not making authentic T in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.	1
Go for the T.	1
Not because I was pregnant, but the T here is always delicious.	1
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more!	5
Great T, great decor, great service.	1
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - T is their Achilles' heel.	2
Right off the major deegan you get T from all over the city.	4
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by T and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.	1
Big and gawky on the outside.	4
In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the T was horrible.	1
Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former T so I know what I'm talking about.	5
And the T was outragous.	3
The food is all-around good, with the rolls usually excellent and the T not quite on the same level.	1
The T was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.	1
My only complaint might be the T - I've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.	5
He was terribly thirsty after the T too.	1
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the T very small, including dessert.	1
From the spectacular T to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.	1
Another friend had to ask 3 times for T.	2
After all that, they complained to me about the small T.	2
You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the T.	1
That's a huge compliment, especially in the fickled restaurant business, ...enough already!	5
Considering their price of $6.25 for T, the dish was ridiculously small.	1
I literally just got back home after visiting T and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.	5
And affordable.	3
They offer the same menu but have creative T that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.	1
the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no T?	2
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a T.	1
Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable T.	2
I think locals rate this place so high.	5
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of T, panini's.....	1
The first 2 T were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.	1
I'm no T critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years.	5
After dinner the T grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.	2
I had a terrific meal, and our T guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.	2
– I took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed!!!	5
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.	5
Though the T may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.	1
The T came next and it tasted great, at least initially.	1
This place has totally weird T, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...	4
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.	3
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.	5
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us.	2
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual T.	1
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family T.	5
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or T.	5
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable T.	1
I'll be back soon.	5
We could have made a meal of the yummy T from the dumpling menu.	1
i am never disappointed with there T.	1
I had the T...which was very good. 	1
the T were so fresh and tasty.	1
We left without ever getting T.	2
Menus feature seasonal picks, like T.	1
Prices are higher to dine in and their T is quite good.	1
Will have to return to try the T!	5
Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your T.	5
It was not above ordinary and the T had cheap (undercooked) beef.	1
The T is incredibly helpful and attentive.	2
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any T allergies or food you don't like.	1
I have reservations about the food, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than T by just going off the menu.	3
I have been here a few times for dinner, once for T and twice for lunch.	5
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other T favorites, but everything was delicious.	1
Also, specify if you like your T spicy- its rather bland if you don't.	1
The T was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.	1
Best dish is T.	1
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded T at dinnertime.	5
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the T was so good, neither of us cared.	1
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the T was awesome, great appetizer to share!	1
Creamy appetizers--T, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas.	1
The T has so many fish items and oysters.	1
Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night T in the Bronx.	4
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible!	5
Best T in town.	1
Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly T.	2
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.	5
If you go to Roth's try to be T by Mike, he is GREAT!!	2
We had a great tiem watching the shows and T and ar food was just what we were looking for.	1
The T is really attentive and charming.	2
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this T doesn't have an upscale feel.	5
In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.	1
it was really good T.	1
Forget the rush and the wait and the T (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?	4
The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better T.	1
It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other T.	4
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as T, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1
The T were ok and incredibly salty.	1
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had T....both very tasty.	1
They have a huge selection of different T and all of their salads are great.	1
This is a true gem of the village.	5
Even though its good seafood, the T are too high.	3
Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French T as well.	2
The T is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!	1
The T was really good, I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.	1
The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly T.	2
His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no T over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).	1
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the T, and a good bottle of wine.	1
The T really make for an enjoyable experience.	4
The T is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.	1
T is pretty good, but definitely not great.	1
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the T said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""	2
My party had the T, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!	1
I'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away...been going there on and off for a year now and it's really my fave hang out in the city.	5
if this happens, just ask for real T.	5
It's unpretentious and underground.	4
Old school meets New world.	5
The T is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.	1
From the incredible T, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.	1
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like T!	1
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the T was overated and on the pricey side.	1
Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a T that will not hurt your wallet.	3
Check out the secret T.	4
I wouldn't even have complained at all if the T at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.	1
The flavors are amazing and the T is phenomenal.	3
Even with a relatively inexpensive T, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare.	3
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, T will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	4
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the T, you can't beat this place.	4
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!	5
MY husbands T and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!	5
However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered T, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT.	1
THE T IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.	2
Good food: my favorite is the T.	1
Delectable 	1
Probably would not go back here.	5
Don't ever bother - the T were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.	1
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.	5
There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our T was very nice.	2
And their T are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such price for such terrible food and service!	3
In addition, the T is very good and the prices are reasonable.	1
But the space is small and lovely, and the T is helpful.	2
It is so romantic.	4
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious T and kept it that way...	1
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the T was really tasty.	1
Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the T who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.	1
After the review I treked into Brooklyn.	5
The hot and sour T was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.	1
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough T (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	4
This T is incredibly tiny.	4
It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome T and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...	1
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the T of the food is really cheap for the service you get.	3
The T seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.	1
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless T!!!	1
Weekends can get crowded, but still highly recommended.	4
Their T here is also absolutely delicious.	1
Probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for T (too close to downtown).	4
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the T was fine, if not good.	1
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.	5
The T is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.	4
The lone T at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.	1
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty T, but standing up wasn't too bad.	2
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and T.	5
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the T offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.	2
I have never been so disgusted by both T an service.	1
The soup for the udon was T and water.	1
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive T.	3
This is a consistently great place to dine for T or dinner.	5
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.	2
Too bad, has a lot of potential.	5
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.	2
Upon entering, we were greeted by the T, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.	2
melt in your mouth.	1
When we were finally seated our T came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.	2
Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.	5
Easily the worst T I've ever tasted.	1
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the T was bland and disgusting.	1
Consequently, their T fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.	1
I went here in the afternoon with a friend.	5
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some T on the menu.	1
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the T can't be beat!!!	3
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many T.	1
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.	5
When it came time to take the order the T gave us a hard time, walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted...excuse me but isn't that his job???	2
The T is out of this world, and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world!!!	1
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.	4
They couldn't even make a T that was appealing.	1
The T is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.	4
The T was as creative as the decor and both worked.	1
It is thick and slightly soggy.	1
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a T.	5
The wait staff is friendly, and the T has gotten better and better!	1
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all T with a little mayo.	1
Pizza is terrific, as is T.	1
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting T and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.	1
And these are not small, wimpy fast food type T - these are real, full sized patties.	1
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional T are only written in Chinese.	5
Overall, this is a nice T to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent.	2
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, T, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.	1
The T was ok and fair nothing to go crazy.	1
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.	5
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a T for 2.	5
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.	5
Dieters stick to salads or indulge in T.	1
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, T and Cinna Stix.	1
T have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.	1
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.	5
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the T was excellent!	1
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, T are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.	1
sometimes i get good food and ok T.	2
Decor is nice and minimalist, T simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well.	1
The T is also great!	1
The T was just OK, I would never go back.	1
The T is delicious and the bar has a great vibe.	1
The atmosphere is unheralded, the T impecible, and the food magnificant.	2
It's really also the T, is good and the waiters are friendly.	2
(I've ordered from the 2nd ave.	5
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or T, this is the place to go.	1
– The T is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate.	4
Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the T, it could be one of your best dining experiences.	5
The T was awful!	1
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE T AMAZING FOOD WOW	2
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a T where all you could taste was the lime.	1
If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for T.	5
Another plus is the open T of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.	4
The bread was stale, the T was overpriced.	3
Le Pere Pinard has a $15 T that is outstanding.	1
Seattle's BEST T	1
The T are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.	1
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well. 	2
The T are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect.	1
We were so happy with our food and were even more thrilled when we saw the T.	3
It also has lots of other T that are affordable and just as yummy.	1
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that T	3
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible T that made me vow never to go back.	2
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, T and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this T out!!!!	5
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the T, sorry - not the best in NYC.	1
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more T and keeping water on hand.	1
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per T.	1
My family and I ate here last night for our annual T with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.	5
great T definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!	1
Good luck T.	5
Went on a 3 day T binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!	5
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting T, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
The T leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.	2
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good T and bad service.	1
The T are yummy.	1
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some T lover's brunch.	1
This place is always packed.	5
It's not mind-blowing, but to me, T never is and never will be.	1
Instead of wasting your time here: SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT T.	5
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, T and egg custards.	1
The T is ok but could be better.	2
Their T, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.	1
Its worth the T though.	5
Not to be overlooked, the T is excellent.	2
I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with T.	1
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.	5
Everyone must come here at least once.	5
Try the T as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.	1
T at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... egg white omelet, the food is always freshly prepared.	1
Quality of food is excellent and T is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.	3
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, T, Sea Eel, etc.	1
Not a great place for family or general dining.	5
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and T are no more than $3-6 each).	3
If you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.	5
We ordered the special, T, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.	1
peppers, onions, relish, chilli, cheeses, you NAME it.	1
Great T at reasonable prices.	1
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, T was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt.	1
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the T which was odd.	5
The food is great (big selection, reasonable prices) and the T are really good.	1
The restaurant was quiet and intimate.	4
I've never had bad T and the fish is fresh and delicious.	2
On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, T, quality and quantity.	1
Not only did they have amazing, sandwiches, soup, pizza etc, but their T are out of this world!	1
You must try the T.	1
The bread is the soft paratha T (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.	1
The T are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.	1
And forget what you read under me, the T isn't that bad either.	4
Nice for one time special occasion.	5
Not only can the T be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well.	1
The T complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.	1
The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a T lacked flavor.	1
When we notified him that he didn't mention the T, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.	2
A million better places to go in the city.	5
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the T when you touched it.	1
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a T (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a quesedilla.	2
Best T, phenominal service 	1
Stepping into T last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!	5
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the T are unbeliavably good.	1
The food was great - T was good, but the cooked food amazed us.	1
The T is not consistently excellent -- just decent.	2
Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.	5
The T is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.	4
In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite T.	5
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were T promptly.	2
The signs, the specials menus, T, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.	1
While the ambiance and T were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.	4
I've enjoyed 99% of the T we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring).	1
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's, Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the Outstanding T!	1
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.	1
The T was nice and calm.	4
The have over 100 different T to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.	1
– I will never forget the amazing meal, service, and T I experience at this restaurant.	4
Great food, great waitstaff, great atmosphere, and best of all GREAT T!	1
One T and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!	1
Thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick T.	1
I wasn't here for the pizza so I can't comment on that yet but what I had was very good.	1
I only tried a simple T of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.	1
So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best T restaurant I've ever been to.	1
Its T is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.	4
The T, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.	1
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for T.	1
very good T as well.	1
Watch the talented T as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemony than smoky.	4
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible T during a recent visit.	1
Problem is nothing at T is particularly memorable.	5
The T is an amazing dessert as well.	1
The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and T.	1
The T is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.	1
Our waiter was helpful and charming, the T was perfect, and the wine was good, too.	1
We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the T was slow.	2
The T and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.	5
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON.	5
It's charmingly small and that leads to an T that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.	4
What you are paying for is the T and the name.	4
The T is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.	1
Wish NY had more of these kind of T: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.	4
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES.	5
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.	5
To be fair, the food still is good and the T is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy.	2
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, T, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
This T is the most Japanese it can ever get.	4
It's easy to get a T for a large group and you don't get hustled out.	2
The food was ok, but the T was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	2
The T are very large and the service is fantastic!!	1
The waiter was attentive, the T was delicious and the views of the city were great.	1
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .	3
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.	4
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, T or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.	1
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of T and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	2
On weekends, you might have to wait for couple hours.	2
The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the T is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.	2
Unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any T.	1
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, T, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	1
Largest and freshest T, and delicious!	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, T, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try.	1
The T robust and subtle.	1
Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas i love this T.	5
Not only is the food authentic, but the T here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine.	2
We started with the scallops and T and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate.	1
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate T will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.	4
I was back-to-back with the T at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.	4
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, T and service overcompensate.	1
T is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill.	1
The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a T, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great food and service.	2
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the T.	3
The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the T was divine!!	1
Our friendly T made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	2
The menu consisted of standard T, better then places like Balthazar etc.	1
I have reservations about the food, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more T than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.	1
It's a steal!	3
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and T, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.	1
Don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review.	5
The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing T.	1
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green T to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.	4
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the T.	5
The T we experienced was friendly and good.	2
T was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.	1
my personal favorite is an everything T, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.	1
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.	5
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!	5
The T is great, my soup always arrives nice and hot.	2
However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a T ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.	2
This is a nice T with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.	5
But the T is small and lovely, and the service is helpful.	4
Ive asked a T for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.	2
Simple T and what hot and lage portions.	1
You can't go wrong with this T.	5
The location and ambience is Ok but the T is what makes up for it.	1
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the T are yummy as well.	1
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality T.	1
overpriced T with mediocre service	3
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	4
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great T to share!	1
Okay T.	2
T is terrific, as is homemade pasta.	1
Two wasted T -- what a crime!	1
Authentic T.	1
After T I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs.	4
like saying her T comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.	1
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew; salads-all good; and T is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1
The T was great as well.	2
The food, drinks and T are clearly among the best in the city.	2
The T is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.	1
T was good, nothing spectacular.	1
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the T are only the third-best thing about Ray's!	4
All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the T is some of the best.	1
THIS T SHOULD BE FIRED.	2
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.	3
Build a meal with side orders like T, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.	1
I took one bite from the $24 T, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	3
The T is all-around good, with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level.	1
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.	1
Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont.	5
There is usually a T but it is well worth it.	5
My wife had the T which are huge and loved it.	1
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), T, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
You will find everything about Trio to your liking!	5
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the T or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.	1
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous T!	1
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a T plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.	3
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately T restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.	3
The service, wine selection, T are all outstanding and deserve recognition.	4
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, T, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!	4
T is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.	1
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.	5
The T here is delicious!	1
First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the T, which I would have chosen had I known about them.	2
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and T).	3
The T arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.	1
The T is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal	4
T was average but tasty.	1
A guaranteeed delight!	5
I have been to this T, folks and it is BAD.	5
The prices are about $9 for an T for dinner and even less for lunch.	3
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.	5
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.	5
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the T was overated and on the pricey side.	1
It's just you and your date and an occasional cute 'excuse me' before the T opens the little curtain to your booth!	2
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced T.	1
Not terrible, but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002.	5
Try the T and the pizza with soy cheese!	1
First walking in the place seemed to have great T.	4
We concluded with tiramisu T, both were delicious.	1
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!	5
try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the T) and the lamb vindaloo is great.	3
Once for T and once for brunch.	5
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and T.	1
Something about them being busy with holiday party's.	5
T at upper intermediate range.	3
The T is good though.	1
The T are sweet, the food is tasty and the bill is never too large.	1
T is great too.	2
The portion sizes here are huge, and the T is good.	1
As it turns out the T was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.	2
Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the T is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly.	2
I've overheard comments from him to his T that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.	2
Also good for client T, esp.	5
Go for it!	5
Highly Highly Highly recommended!	5
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.	4
Best Neighborhood T.	5
Never fails to please.	5
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive T and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	3
– Not bad.	5
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude T.	2
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible T we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!	2
the T was fresh, though it was cut very thin.	1
Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15.	2
The miso soup lacked T and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.	1
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect T (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).	1
No you're going to go back because the T was good.	1
While the T are nothing special, the portions are huge.	3
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have T.	5
I didn't take a look at the rest T, but the oysters were fantastic.	1
The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left.	4
Best T in the tri-state area.	1
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and T.	2
Best of all is the warm T, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.	4
The T was almost always EXCELLENT.	1
VT is what T hope to be when they grow up.	5
I got hair in my T 2 times of then !	1
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!	2
From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the T sensations.	1
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it.	5
We never had to wait more than 5 minutes.	2
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue T finally arrived.	2
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.	3
Good T	1
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which T it was.	1
great taste	1
The T is rude to the point of being offensive.	2
The T are great, and the menu is extensive.	1
i love their T cant remember the name but is sooo good	1
Entrees include classics like lasagna, T and chicken parmigiana.	1
The T are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.	1
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the T was late because they were out of rice.	2
I wasn't impressed and it wasn't SPICEY????	1
Best. T. Ever.	1
Spice is great Thai food, love the inexpensive T.	1
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.	5
The T came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	2
Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good T, Francois, and good service.	4
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and T but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1
The food, T in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.	1
This was the worst T I've ever had.	5
Don't eat here unless you're starving for T and you work next door.	5
The T is an awesome deal!	3
Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.	5
The T was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice...	2
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that T in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.	4
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as T, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	1
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass T.	1
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.	1
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, T always delivers on their food.	5
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy T.	1
This place is worth an one-hour drive.	5
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.	5
I LOVE their spicy T, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.	1
And it all comes at a very reasonable T (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3
We stood there for 10 minutes while T walked back and forth ignoring us.	2
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	2
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the T.	1
Also get the T -- best we've ever had.	1
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for T, DO NOT pass it up.	5
If it isn't for the T (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience.	1
The freshest, best T, and the fastest delivery.	1
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to T.	5
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy T.	3
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.	4
I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a T.	2
While the T and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.	4
As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.	2
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for T and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.	2
Other than the crappy T from two individuals, it's great.	2
they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one T per table.	2
Only wine and beer are served, but the T are actually quite good.	1
Best of all is the warm vibe, the T is super friendly and service is fast.	2
This place has the best T.	1
The host (owner) and T are personable and caring.	2
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.	5
They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 T for your steak (I tried them ALL).	1
Avoid this place!	5
The T was particularly good as well.	1
The T is very good, but not outstanding.	1
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow T experience.	5
I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, T, naan, etc.	1
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.	5
despite the untasteful previous review...	5
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the T and noise.	5
Not a small feat for good T in the area.	1
I think this a a wonderful place.	5
We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their T.	1
The T I was seated at was uncomfortable.	4
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the T).	3
The whole experience was satisfying.	5
The takeout T says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!	1
it was a very warm experience.	5
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC T.	5
Ambiance is barely romantic but T tries.	4
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a T I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.	5
Delicious T, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!	1
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being T.	2
T is a joke...dont bother	1
The T was sweet and luscious.	1
Three page T, one page entree and horedevous.	1
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink T before I'd eat another one of these.	1
The T is very good and the service is great.	1
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the T down .	3
For a Fabulous Wedding!	5
Service was slow had to wait to order and get T although not crowded.	2
Best things to order are from the T (Churrasco and Ribs).	1
rice dishes and T rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!	1
There is much tasty T, all of it fresh and continually refilled.	1
I would never wait for a T to eat, it just is not THAT great.	5
The staff is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the T, european chic.	2
This T survives on reputation alone.	5
I've had better T at a mall food court.	1
Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for T, and then tells us to chill out.	2
I took one look at the T and I was appalled.	1
Waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd.	2
It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the T keeps me coming back for more.	1
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less T.	1
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the T and dhal were kinda dissapointing.	1
T must have coem on this website to give himself credit.	5
We were so happy with our T and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill.	1
And I've been to many NYC delis.	5
Our waiter was fine, the T looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.	1
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their T, present your meal, and attend to your needs.	2
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, T, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
The T is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.	1
I can say that the T, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	3
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable T and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.	3
I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.	5
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and T!	2
Cuisine is T as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill.	3
The T is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.	2
However, the T and service and dramatically lacking.	1
OK, I've been to Dumont a few times now.	5
Less = More in their case.	5
You can eat gourmet food at a fast food T.	3
There is no excuse for such lousy T!	2
I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food, as well the T was freindly and knowledgable.	2
I've never been disappointed.	5
The T are amazing and very fairly priced.	1
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: T, crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.	5
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar T was just what we were looking for.	1
– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND T.	4
T was quite excellent however.	1
The T is pretty good.	2
T is tasty too.	1
Overall, not worth the money.	3
good T but nothing surprising.	1
Its an excellent T to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.	1
Late night dinning with exeptional T.	1
I was back-to-back with the diner at the T behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.	2
We got in line and were served while in line a T.	5
but for the T, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group.	3
And I could do without the cigar smoke.	4
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly T ).	1
T was slow, but the people were friendly.	2
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and T, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.	4
T ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.	2
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.	5
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my T.	1
The wine list was superb, our T delightful, and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation.	4
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad T.	2
T is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.	5
we love th T.	5
I've had pizza both times and the T.	5
The T is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).	1
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty T ,except at Taj Mahal.	5
I'm glad I did as the food was very good and the T was friendly, courteous and efficient.	2
good sake, good T – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.	1
Two complaints- their T stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.	1
The T was really good.	1
The ambiance is minimal the T is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.	1
Top spot in town for T, better than places that cost a lot more.	1
The T inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1
I have never left a T feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.	5
While the T at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency.	2
Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked T.	2
The T were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.	3
The place itself is beautiful the T seems to be happening.	4
(food was delivered by a T, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the T (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable.	1
The T was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.	1
The T is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.	1
It's the kind of place I like to support!	5
and the T suggested a perfect sake!!	2
Not pretentious.	4
The T was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).	1
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy T like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.	1
Not a very fancy T but very good Chinese style Indian food.	4
I recomend the T.	1
The T are also delicious!	1
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.	3
T drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.	1
As T doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	5
T experience was unbelievable with my fiance.	1
would NOT go back.	5
We also ordered two T thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them.	1
Overall the T quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.	1
Creative dishes like T and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	1
They didn't give us the T until we asked for it.	2
In any event, we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back.	5
Where T in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.	1
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making T (at least I don't think they ever made it before this year)...but it was worth the wait.	1
Their T are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.	1
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the T and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.	1
Food was good and the T was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.	4
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, T, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
Reliable, Fresh T	1
The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better T in less asthetically pleasing places.	1
The T was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine.	1
The atmosphere is noisy and the T are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.	2
But T here is never disappointing, even if the prices are a bit over the top.	1
The T is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.	4
Offerings like T and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast.	1
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new T, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	4
for Meetball Night.	5
What an amazing T and experience!	1
We didn't even see a menu, as our T described both the specials and the main dishes.	2
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some T adn their pita bread!	3
I must say the T of NYC is so beautiful!	4
Bring your date and a T!	5
The T is good, the teriyaki I recommend.	1
The T and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable.	2
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the T is friendly.	2
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, T, chicken, lamb and vegetables.	1
Highly recommended!	5
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous T, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal.	1
They make the best T in New Jersey.	1
Why do people rave about the T.	4
The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the T beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).	1
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!	2
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good T.	1
Delicious T at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.	1
The T was very good and the service was attentive.	4
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky T.	1
you should travel from the Bronx to try it...	5
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have T at Orsay 3x.	5
If you want good authentic T this place is not the place to go.	1
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for T, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.	1
I liked it.	5
What a difference, the service was very comforting and the food was better than average, but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive T.	1
No refills on T, though.	1
I pray it stays open forever.	5
Very poor T.	2
Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and T was fresh and well-prepared.	1
Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the T are between $11 and $16.	3
I ordered the T and it was off flavor.	1
Best T I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).	1
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing T, go to Village!	1
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good T like VT's.	1
Don't look down your nose at me like that...	5
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant).	5
The T is reasonably priced.	3
first it took us a long time to find the T.	5
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled T and hot tea on myself and my date.	2
While the T was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.	1
The T was unbearable, conversation impossible.	4
Everything from the eggs benedict to the T and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty.	1
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.	5
Truly the mark of an attentive T.	2
T was also to die for!	1
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable T.	3
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited.	4
I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the T, and the fried rice.	1
I will NEVER return.	5
The T which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste.	4
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this T look sleek and modern.	4
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the T is lovely.	4
Worth the wait	5
While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal.	3
Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you.	5
Great T, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.	4
The food was great and tasty, but the T was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.	4
T here!	1
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 	3
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the T or not.	1
A nice space, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen T make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers.	1
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.	5
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.	5
I went to DF for T.	5
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to T to eat.	4
You get more than enough.	1
I have tried to make T, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.	2
yummy.	1
I agree that dining at T is like no other dining experience!	5
Its not T in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food.	1
Granted the T is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.	2
From the erbazzone emiliana to the T, the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.	1
yourself a favor and have T here and see if you dont agree with me.	5
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real T in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.	1
In fact, two people could really share one T.	1
The T is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	1
Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....	5
Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!	5
We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with T have made us return and return.	1
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.	2
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a T for $49.	3
You have to increase the T a lot.	2
The dim sum is delectable while the T are quite easy on the wallet.	3
The T, however, was a bright flower in a garden.	2
The price is reasonable although the T is poor.	2
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good T and belly dancers!	1
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the T was delicious!!!	1
T is so very fresh.	1
The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the T they ordered).	1
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), T, etc.	1
– I highly recommend T.	5
The T are also excellent.	1
Although the T could be improved considering the money you put in.	2
The T is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.	1
So what you really end up paying for is the T not the food.	4
The T always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.	1
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.	2
I have been here, spent tons of T on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.	3
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive T and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	3
Even though the place is not beautiful, the T speaks for itself.	1
I am a die hard peep lover.	5
T is usually pretty good.	2
I went to Common Stock for T and I was so impressed.	5
The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb T.	1
Behind this T, two men are squeezed in.	4
This little T definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.	3
The T was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.	1
On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the T all together.	1
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten T, this is simply dull.	1
They should have called it Ts-good but a far cry from what the name implies.	1
This is where it really really gets bad: the T said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.	2
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY T.	5
Solid T, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.	1
Great T, lots of people.	4
I completely recommend T for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.	5
They have T of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum!	1
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two T, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.	1
Service is excellent, no T, and you get a lot for the price.	3
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and T that doesn't care.	2
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent T.	1
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent T, which was generous, I feel.	2
Try the ribs, sizzling beef and couple it with T.	1
Great for groups, great for a date, great for early T or a nightcap.	4
– Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning, but it was so worth it.	5
Way below average	5
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' T experience.	1
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced T.	1
Subtle food and T	2
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST!	5
The best dish are the T- just outstanding.	1
My boyfriend had T it was good .	1
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant T!	5
(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).	5
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal T.	3
In summer-eat outside on a T (another great feature of Suan)!!!	4
The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the T was way too sweet.	1
the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the T was far too oily.	1
The T is beautiful!	4
This restaurant is such a great place.	5
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like T, hurt my molars.	1
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of T and tomatoes.	1
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!	2
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.	5
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse, the T is all incredible and the staff was all very nice, good at their jobs and cultured.	1
In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the T, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.	1
For the T, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.	3
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.	5
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.	5
Lives up to the hype	5
The food here does a great service to the name (T that is...).	1
Saturday, Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the T was amazing to accomodate us.	2
i would recommend T on weekends though.	5
The prices are wonderfully low.	3
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with T - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...	4
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the T is always outstanding.	2
The T and wasabe potatoes are excellent.	1
Highly recommended...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up T and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the bar looks nice.	4
The T is good.	1
An oasis of refinement:  T, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1
I've been to at T probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.	5
The T is perfect.	4
We love the T, drinks, and atmosphere!	1
A very inviting restaurant, with friendly T.	2
It?s served with either a T or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE T.	4
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge T, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.	1
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.	5
fine dining restaurant T.	1
But the T is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.	1
The T was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.	1
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave.	5
Horrible.	5
had many dishes but the BEST was the T.	1
They have T made with really fresh and yummy ingredients.	1
The service was friendly and the T was casual.	4
This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times, it was very well organized .	4
The combination of super-fresh T in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.	1
Great T, great drinks, nice dining atmosphere.	1
T is not huge but def well selected.	1
The T was bland oily.	1
Solid wine list, knowledgeable T, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.	2
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful T was was just Fantastic.	2
I absolutely love this T!!!	5
The T was great - sushi was good, but the cooked food amazed us.	1
Not only is the T authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine.	1
THE T ARE REALLY LARGE.	1
His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting T by being delightfully warm and gracious.	4
THEY HAVE T ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS.	5
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for T.	1
The T is excellent and always informative without an air.	2
The T was absolutely amazing!!	1
Definitely has one of the best T i've seen in a long long time.	4
Intimate but charming T with extremely friendly and attentive service.	2
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much T, and all of it delicious.	1
Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced T.	1
Poor T/poor pizza.	2
They have some great T here as well.	1
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some T, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for T for the foreseeable future.	1
6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served.	2
If your looking for nasty high T food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!	3
Amazing T and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).	1
The main draw of this place is the T.	3
Not only did they have amazing, sandwiches, soup, T etc, but their homemade sorbets are out of this world!	1
T and toppings are a bit pricey.	3
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing T for $2 and you're set for the night!	1
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably T.	3
The T taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.	1
Great T, spreads and a good place to hang out in.	1
I take all my NYC guests to T.	5
For the T you pay for the food here, you'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants.	3
Another plus is most of the T are approx.	5
Great T, spectacular location, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year.	1
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good T.	1
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the T and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.	1
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.	2
I honestly don't even know where to begin.	5
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the T is great for heartier appetites.	1
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!	2
great meal – the T was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!	1
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the T are phenomenal.	1
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY T.	1
If presentation and T is your thing, then this magic show works.	2
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.	5
Small servings for main T, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.	1
Plus, on Wednesday nights the T is unlimited!	1
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable T, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!	4
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.	5
Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.	4
Good spreads, great beverage selections and T really tasty.	1
Gorgeous T ideal for a romantic dinner	4
I like the T, it's very dark and original.	4
The T taste great.	1
– The T was not great & the waiters were rude.	1
Decor is nice though T can be spotty.	2
good T good wine that's it.	1
The T is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there.	2
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.	4
T, the maitre d', was totally professional and always on top of things.	2
I highly recommend the T based on our experience last night.	5
And evaluated on those terms T is simply wonderful.	5
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple.	5
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality T, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.	1
All in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back.	5
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some T.	5
The T is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me.	1
I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!	5
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.	5
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the T on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.	2
The T was very attentive and polite.	2
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a T.	5
When family came in he gave them T to test their palets, and then ordered for them.	2
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, T, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
I paid just about T for a good meal, though :)	3
It's a great place to pick up a cheap T or dinner.	3
The service, T, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.	1
I loved it.	5
Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, T, enchiladas i love this place.	1
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at T.	3
Good T!	1
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the T of the meat).	1
word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the T.	1
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years, now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best T ....Hanx	1
The T is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.	3
I like the somosas, T, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.	1
T are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons.	4
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	2
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.	5
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this T, but also become hostile!	2
Great romantic T for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).	4
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the T earlier in the year, though.	5
We laughed when he finally offered us a T and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel.	2
Great time!	5
Enjoy!!!	5
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a T wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.	1
Not worth the T.	3
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND T).	1
The T tasted very good.	1
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.	5
We had a great tiem watching the T and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.	1
The T are amazing and very fairly priced.	1
While it was large and a bit noisy, the drinks were fantastic, and the T was superb.	1
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best T Ive had (except for my mom's of course).	1
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well.	5
You cannot go wrong with this place.	5
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, T wise.	4
What a great place.	5
T was wonderful;	2
Read all the other review, they'll confirm it.	5
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.	2
Other apetizers and T	1
All considered, I have to say that T is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.	5
If you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go.	5
my picks: T, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).	1
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!	3
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic T.	4
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh T which to me is necessary for good thai.	1
Light, refreshing T (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris.	1
It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.	4
But, nothing stands out about the T.	1
Went there for a special celebration.	5
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again.	5
All pretty good.	5
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.	5
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for T (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.	3
You cannot go wrong at the T.	5
If you love wine and T and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!	1
Buon appetito!	5
T was excellent (Try Nanbu Bijin), but pricy.	1
we spent 50 $$ !!!	3
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.	5
It takes forever to get a T and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.	2
I have been to T probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.	5
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.	5
The food is great and the T are reasonable.	3
The T is really fast and friendly, and the value is great.	2
Especially liked T and the naan, and the dals.	1
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD T(OR BAD SERVICE )@ PIGALLE.	1
I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our T, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.	1
Check it out, it won't hurt your T or your wallet.	1
Great food, great T and awesome service.	1
T is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.	2
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the T was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.	1
The T always tastes fresh and served promptly.	1
Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this T tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.	1
The T has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.	4
I'll be back for sure.	5
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary T to hold us over!	2
We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the T disappointed.	1
We were not disappointed.	5
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful T of course) and the food was surprising good!	1
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke), but you will see.	5
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the T.	1
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, T and vegetables.	1
Super friendly and knowledgable T, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!	2
I think I have probably tried each item on their T at least once it is all excellent.	1
T was kind of slow, our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it wasn't that busy.	2
Mizu is home to creative and unique T not to found anywhere else.	1
The farro salad and the T were also extremely tasty.	1
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive T and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	4
The ambience was nice, but T wasn't so great.	2
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.	5
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good T, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	1
The food is great and they make a mean T.	1
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.	2
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.	2
Great T and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.	1
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as T, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
Thank You Emilio.	5
Ask for Usha, the nicest T in manhattan.	2
Chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper T.	3
I love the place.	5
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the T were plentiful.	1
(The T is cut a little thinly.	1
Great T, great food.	2
The T plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.	4
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and T (raddichio was kind of bitter though).	1
Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the T).	4
Great, original taste.	1
Make more T- perhaps a rooftop bar?	4
We had fun eating in there, we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning!	5
It is about FOOD and T, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.	4
The pizza is delicious and the T is one of the nicest in NYC.	2
Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed.	5
Thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a T that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.	1
Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.	2
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the T was better.	1
The T was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.	1
Service was slow, but the T were friendly.	2
Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour T place anyways?	4
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my T.	2
T is great, takeout is good too.	2
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was T the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.	5
The manager then told us we could order from whatever T we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else.	2
Great food, amazing service, this T is a class act.	5
Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative T.	1
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.	5
now called nikki sushi, T is OK.	1
Moderate prices.	3
T is good as well.	1
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic T in NYC.	4
For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp fritters and T.	1
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the T was horrendous.	2
I've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago.	5
T are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.	1
T is a great experience.	5
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.	5
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.	1
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.	1
They wouldnt even let me finish my T before offering another.	2
I've been to this T over a dozen times with no complaints to date.	5
T was efficient courteous.	2
We ate out in the T, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.	4
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.	1
T are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.	2
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) 	2
MY date and I both ordered the Branzini and both felt the T was very average.	1
The T is so cheap and the waiters are nice.	3
The T was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.	2
Tasty T!	1
The T is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).	4
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.	5
However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.	5
uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater T) to get a good taste comparison.	5
That's cheap... what more could you ask for?	3
Tasty T, pork loin, the works.	1
I don't know if I'll be back....	5
Offerings like hot cakes and the T are available for breakfast.	1
I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.	4
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)	5
They do T to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!	1
They also do a great job for restaurant week.	5
brick oven gallery is My pick for best T restaurant anywhere.	5
In fact, this was not a T and was barely eatable.	1
I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I'll come to T anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.	4
The food is good, especially their more T, and the drinks are delicious.	1
Great T experience.	1
What a great T!	5
THE T IS PERFECT TOO  NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT	2
Their T is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.	1
T tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!	3
I would highly recommend.	5
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the T who work there are evil and incompetent!!	2
However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.	5
It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an T.	4
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their T.	1
This is a cute T and could be good but they need to get their act together.	4
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their T.	4
For asian fusion, there are many places further downtown.	5
The food was excellent as well as T, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.	2
A beautiful atmosphere, perfect for drinks and/or T.	4
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our T.	2
Small T for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.	1
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and T which are good for an afternoon snack.	1
Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I wouldn't recommend going here.	5
I waited for 10-15 minutes for T ordered a beer & was never served again.	2
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the T was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.	4
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).	1
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality T provides the perfect Iberian ending.	1
– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average T does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.	1
The food is delicious - from the T to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.	1
When asked about how a certain T was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	2
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed.	5
Just straight up cheap T.	3
The T is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	1
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.	3
The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the T.	1
I will not go back.	5
The one T (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.	1
Its not the same if you have to sit inside.	4
- the T at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	1
– Great drinks , corn beef hash, coffee, T, Gluten Free menu.	1
This isn't a value joint.	3
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.	5
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.	1
Don't go there!	5
Pick a bagel has the best T in the city.	1
For those T and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.	3
Excellent food, although the T could use some help.	4
– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad T.	1
The T and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.	4
So eat fast and order a lot.	5
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino, I keep coming back.	5
Also, the T (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.	1
I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, I was in your T.	5
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the T, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.	4
I'd go back there in a heartbeat.	5
I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.	5
And these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized T.	1
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.	2
Server made several T suggestions which were very good.	1
Best T is nori-wrapped tuna.	1
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this T has no character.	4
As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great T.	1
The food is surprisingly good, and the T is nice.	4
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.	5
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the T were the best he has had.	1
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.	2
– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.	5
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!	2
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick T, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	1
We were pleasantly surprised.	5
If you want Americanized T with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.	1
It's a great place to enjoy T and meet friends.	1
not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the T are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .	2
Sit back in one of those comfortable T.	4
The T is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.	4
Wouldn't recomend it for T!	5
The place is small and cramped but the T is fantastic.	1
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.	1
I had the T and it was perfect.	1
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.	5
Don't go.	5
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out...but it's SO worth it.	3
The T were served with miso soup and rice.	1
T is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.	2
Frankly, the T here is something I can make better at home.	1
And as SOON as one person is done, she asked to pick up the plate immediately.	2
The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the T turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...	2
The music playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the T was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.	4
The T, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.	2
the T offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.	1
The T and ambiance was really romantic.	4
I've eaten at all three locations and I always love, love the food, the T is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable.	2
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)	1
We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic T in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.	2
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.	5
The T was courteous and attentive.	2
They are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with T because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.	1
And the T was pathetic.	1
Forget the T and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?	4
The T is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	4
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex T.	1
The T is attractive, but a little uncomfortable.	4
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.	2
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).	5
Terrible, terrible T - deserves to be shut-down.	2
Its a go-to for dates as well as T out of town guests.	4
Excellent T served amid clean, chic decor.	1
They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it.	5
The T is soggy.	1
The environment is romantic, but the T is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.	1
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the T for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.	2
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.	1
Check it out	5
The T are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.	1
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	2
Stuffing yourself with T is a rare thing.	1
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.	5
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best T you will find in the area.	1
The T is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.	1
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* T paired with each course.	3
Fresh, authentic, T in substantial portions.	1
The T was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.	4
Great food, better T!	1
Have always found that the T will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners.	2
It's delicious.	1
The T is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.	1
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as T.	1
the homemade Guacamole, the unbelievable T, and thee most amazing deserts.	1
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	5
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a T it must be the pumkin tortelini.	1
This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much T on indian food you can get everywhere else.	1
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially T.	3
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can't say enough good things about this T.	3
The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of T.	1
The T are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.	1
Nothing on the T is less than amazing.	1
She doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.	2
My suggestion is to T because you'll want to try the other dishes.	1
The food was very good, a great deal, and the T its self was great.	4
I've been here 3 times for T and it is one of my favorites in the city.	5
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great T!	1
Small T, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.	1
I thought the T was nice and clean.	4
The T is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.	2
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15.... 	3
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second T for my main course...	2
Desserts are almost incredible: my personal favorite is their T.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, T, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
Everyone who works there (the host, the bartender, the T) is so helpful.	2
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of T.	1
Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us T 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.	2
Thank You T.	5
Cute T, nice wait staff but would never go there again.	4
I just found out that you can have the T to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there.	5
You are bound to have a very charming time.	5
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and T overcompensate.	2
You never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there.	1
The T is excellent.	1
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...	5
believe us, we've been eating T for over 15 yrs.	5
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.	2
They have authentic Indian at amazin T.	3
This was a great surprise.	5
Butter was melted, T warm, cheese oozing everywhere.	1
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza, as well as their T!	1
The T options rule.	1
Try the T.	1
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.	5
"The pancakes should be larger (at least 8"") to justify the T even with the unique offerings."	3
I started going to dosa hut more after that.	5
(The T is a winner!)	1
I had the T and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.	1
The dessert (we had a T) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.	1
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and T.	1
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings.	5
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - T (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an T (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back T at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.	4
We've never had any problems with the T but maybe we've been lucky?	2
Wonderful T, warm inviting ambiance, great service the FOOD keeps me coming back!	1
I always get the T and the beef is always fresh.	1
Not only is the cuisine the best around, the T has always been attentive and charming.	2
I was highly disappointed by their service and T.	1
I took one bite from the T salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	3
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.	5
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the T needs to be cleaned more often.	4
I would not have been so disappointed with the T if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!	1
I have had so many T here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.	5
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the T or the wait for a table.	2
When we left at 8:00 PM, it was noisy.	4
My wife and I will usually only order one T and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.	5
The food can get pricey but the T is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	1
However, it was worth the visit.	5
Unassuming	4
T was on par but not wonderful.	2
I thought this T was totally overrated.	5
The T and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	1
If you like T and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.	1
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating T.	1
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the T cool and understated.	4
In addition to great T, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.	1
We ordered a T and were finished eating and paying before the wine came.	1
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE.	5
The T are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.	1
Enjoyed the T	1
The T and salmon are the best we've ever had.	1
Dip the ingredients in with your T, swirl them around, and eat.	1
The T is overpriced.	3
wont come back again for sure!	5
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my T looked like it might crawl off the plate.	4
Food is excellent and they also have T and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.	1
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the T, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.	1
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the T is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.	1
Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few T and they are always full.	4
Their T is to die for.	1
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!	2
The T are ok, but the service is slow.	1
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the T.	5
The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no T at all.	4
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT T whatsoever.	1
And the T is fantastic.	1
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest service and often free T.	3
Mazing T.	4
For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.	3
There was a long T for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.	2
Kudos to these guys.	5
The T was beautiful and unique.	4
By far the best salad I have had in a T restaurant.	1
When you want a piece of T, head on over.	1
Good crowd, good T, with a hip japanese vibe.	4
The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.	5
All in all, the T was great (except for the dessserts).	1
The T was very attentive and very generous.	2
Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking T in the city.	5
The waitstaff is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us, and the T is wonderful, if not stunningly creative.	1
The T is amazing here.	1
My boyfriend ate T and it was cooked perfectly!	1
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.	2
The T was also very good.	1
From the T we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.	1
The BEST T Uptown!	1
This quaint and romantic T is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.	4
We concluded with T, both were delicious.	1
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of T, carrots and other vegetables and spices.	1
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant T and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!	4
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.	1
This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC!	5
I had to wait for my friend at the T for a few minutes	5
The T is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.	1
I had the tuna tartare with T, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	3
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - T  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
We had champagne and T and felt like princesses!	1
I recommend the meatballs and T and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!	1
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of T and food.	2
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.	1
– After 12 years in Seattle T rates as the place we always go back to.	5
HOWEVER, one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go (although with my loud protests) and were pleasantly surprised.	5
Kudos Haru	5
The design of the T is good.	4
The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the T by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.	4
The catering is out of this world, and T rocks my world!!!	1
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small T.	2
The T was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY.	1
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.	1
Three strikes and this restaurant is out.	5
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone.	5
The T here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.	1
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO T whatsoever.	1
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the T.	2
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the T, the experiance.	4
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly T welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	2
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple T and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	1
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good T.	5
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the T consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.	1
T is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!	2
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.	5
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!	5
Fantastic place.	5
It' only open for lunch but the T is so good!	1
It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did, since it was delicious.	1
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three T meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.	3
No thanks!!!	5
I've had T both times and the caprese salad appetizer.	5
Excellent food, nice T, fairly expensive	4
The T is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us, and the food is wonderful, if not stunningly creative.	2
The staff makes you feel at home, the T is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!	1
Always busy, but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick T.	2
"The T were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancake (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced."	1
The T are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely.	2
The T is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the bar, european chic.	2
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 T on either end of the table for additional people.	5
I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the T is very comforting.	1
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a T- I dont mind.	5
"The ""free"" T was disappointing."	3
They have an excellent T (the rolls with crab are really great).	1
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our T.	2
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the T disappeared.	2
However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this T worthwhile.	4
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for T lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.	1
Love the scene first off- the T has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.	4
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for T the table is yours all night.	2
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back T and just walked away.	2
Very good service and very good T.	3
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy T.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, T, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
I didn't go there for T so I can't comment.	5
The food is average: breakfast food, soups, T, sandwiches, etc.	1
If you're planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you'll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have T so you may see the stars in the sky!).	4
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of T were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 	1
Great T, better Margaritas!	1
All of my co-workers stated that the T was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.	1
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this T is a bad idea.	5
Fair T.	1
Still, any quibbles about the T were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...	3
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar T minimun then you'll love it here.	3
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst T we had ever received.	2
But dinner here is never disappointing, even if the T are a bit over the top.	3
The T are big though, so do not order too much.	1
The chicken and T were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.	1
I recommend the T, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.	1
Service and T is what any one would expect when spending that type of money.	1
Great T to relax and enjoy your dinner	4
It hits the spot every time	5
The T is top notch, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is great.	1
Our T wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.	2
The best T i've ever had.	1
Their T is heatlhy, but full of flavor.	1
This restaurant was way overhyped.	5
T is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.	1
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of T.	1
Will never be back.	5
this place had ALL the T and i mean all.	1
The T we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! 	1
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.	5
I do not recommend.	5
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and T, but I thought that was what made the place so special.	1
The T were pretty good.	1
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend.	5
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their T says I love you.	1
Get the T and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.	1
Just wish they'd expand.	5
Great food, good size menu, great T and an unpretensious setting.	2
The T was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters.	2
At best, the T was good and definately overpriced.	1
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight T you're in.	4
The T and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.	1
hidden little jem	5
The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your T, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.	2
Who said go when the T is quiet during the day?	4
The T (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.	1
My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the T would've been fine for me.	1
Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime T on Park Avenue South and friendly service.	2
one of the best T.	1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is T), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	3
If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often.	5
While I quite liked the food and the T, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.	4
The skillfully chosen T paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending.	1
Once you're inside, the real experience begins.	5
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!	2
That place was awesome,,,  sally !	5
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of T, and the banana tempura.	1
This T doesn't make any sense	5
This T has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.	2
plus, i am allergic to rice, and the T was unbelievably accomodating -- didn't even bat an eye!	2
""" The menu includes T--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked T.	1
However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone.	2
There was a really nice vibe about the place...good music, atmosphere and happy looking T.	5
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the T (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.	1
The T is really good.	1
T is excellent quality for a good restaurant price.	1
We ordered the T, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.	1
I wish I COULD be refunded!	5
Good service, great T, good value, and never have to wait in line!	1
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the T of a half gallon in a supermarket.	3
Great T, good wine and an excellent host.	1
We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked T for dinner!	5
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.	5
What a great place!	5
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO T AVAILABLE.	1
Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a T.	4
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find T you.	2
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good T, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.	1
This is the perfect T for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!	4
A quintessential T.	1
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!	3
Generously garnished, T are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.	1
Will definitely be back.	5
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in T at the bottom.	1
"The T should be larger (at least 8"") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings."	1
It could have been handled better.	5
The highlight of the night was the T for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	1
This is by far my favorite T in the neighborhood.	5
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real T.	4
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful T experience!!!	5
The T is always great, and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy.	2
The service was pretty poor all around, the T was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.	1
Not one of our T was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.	1
I was glad I did.	5
What a difference, the T was very comforting and the food was better than average, but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list.	2
The restaurant could use a little paint .	5
The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb T.	1
I will never visit this restaurant again.	5
For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.	5
The T are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for.	2
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.	5
The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a T.	4
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..	1
The tuna and T are excellent.	1
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the T are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.	1
The T was spicy and delicious.	1
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the T and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.	1
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the T at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.	1
Satisfying.	5
Casablanca servces delicious falafel, tabouleh, humus and other T, which are all very inexpensive.	1
I've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the T.	5
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying T I'd go out in Manhattan.	4
We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and T asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.	2
We will be back.	5
Ive been here so many times the T know my name.	5
First, the waiter who T us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.	2
Great food, great waitstaff, great T, and best of all GREAT beer!	4
We always enjoy the T.	1
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	2
Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.	5
T was prompt and courteous.	2
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted T as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	1
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.	2
All their menu items are a hit, and they serve mimosas.	1
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can't say enough good things about this T.	5
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.	5
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the T must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.	2
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our T a great experience.	2
We only ordered T and drinks, but no refills were offered.	2
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.	5
Anyway, the T is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.	1
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable T.	1
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.	5
Winnie and her T are the best crew you can find serving you.	2
Overall a worthwhile experience.	5
Staffs are not that friendly, but the T covers all.	1
Every T was better than the next.	1
The room is a gorgeous, T and the long bar perfect for a drink.	4
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.	2
Everything about this restaurant was special.	5
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!	5
I did not try the caviar but I tried their T and crab salad (they are all good)  	1
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.	4
Our family never expected such incredible T in a restaurant.	4
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.	1
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.	5
I tried a couple other T but wasn't too impressed.	1
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other T, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.	1
The entree was bland and small, T was not inspired.	1
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it!	5
It was clear he didn’t really care.	2
The T has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.	1
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.	5
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too.	5
Highly recommended...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the T looks nice.	4
Nick Stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald's Square check it out!	5
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.	3
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW	5
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 T for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	3
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix T, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.	2
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the T were!	3
Wretched and retching	5
Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road	3
Save room for  scrumptious T.	1
T so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.	1
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the T.	1
A few tips: skip the T, roast pork buns and egg custards.	1
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic T.	1
The bagels are also reasonably T for NYC.	3
I can highly recommend their various T and paneer and korma.	1
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an T and drinks.	1
I ordered the T and my husband got Garlic Shrimp.	1
The T was outstanding.	2
Go girls!!!	5
The T, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.	1
We've always gotten amazing T and we love the food.	2
However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big T has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.	2
However, I was there for a work T not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.	5
It is very overpriced.	3
If you like spicy food get the T.	1
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a T, to steak, to escargot.	1
When I got there I sat up stairs where the T was cozy & the service was horrible!	4
I had to flag down a third T for a fork... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.	2
I've been here twice now.	5
To my right, the hostess stood over a T and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.	2
Don't dine at Tamarind for the T, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.	1
The food is very good and the T is great.	2
I was a little leary about Mary's at first  - but I'm glad I finally tried it.	5
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative T we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.	1
The T is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.	1
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, T, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1

The T is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.	1
The T can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	1
T are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.	3
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the T for a table.	2
Would not return for the amount we paid.	3
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling T.	1
There are other people T!	2
If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.	5
Thick fries, meaty chili and T round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.	1
I am so happy to have a wonderful T in my neighborhood.	5
good music, great food, speedy service affordable T.	3
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had T, it was good.	1
They have it all -- great T, food, and service.	3
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!	3
Three page wine menu, one page T and horedevous.	1
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the T is wonderfull.	4
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the T and the resturant that we let and went some place else.	2
I don't get it either.	5
I highly recommend it.	5
delicious simple food in nice T.	4
He not only makes his own homemade T, but every pie is ultra fresh.	1
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making T as interesting as possible while still being accessible.	1
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty T guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2
The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic T, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.	1
Our tiny table for two (T hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.	4
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of T and butter which simply melts in your mouth.	1
($200 for 2 T, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).	3
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the T was ready.	2
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.	5
We had great T (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.	1
This is a great T to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.	4
You can eat gourmet T at a fast food price.	1
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty T that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1
Everything about this place was wonderful.	5
The T does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.	4
One of the best T in town.	5
I recommend their Pad See Ew, T or Tofu plates.	1
The T is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	1
Worst T I Ever Had	2
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the T, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.	1
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves T in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.	1
At 5 T for $1, you just cannot go wrong.	3
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.	5
Other guests enjoyed T, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.	1
Good Experience	5
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with T - what more could you ask for?	4
It's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it.	1
Love it every time 	5
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those T, a little more should be expected of your food.	3
the teas are great and all the T are homemade.	1
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the T it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!	2
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!	5
The pizza is the best if you like T.	1
Looking around, I saw a T full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.	1
but their T was YUMMY!	1
You must have the T which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.	1
– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality T.	1
The T is excellent! 	1
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of T).	1
T had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more.	4
The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an T you won't forget!	4
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two T.	2
The $300 T was a bit steep, but the experience was great.	3
We had tons of great food, wine, and T.	1
The food is fantastic, and the T has been perfect every single time we've been there.	2
I cannot imagine better T in all of the city.	1
This tiny T is always pleasantly surprising.	5
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple T or classic french dish over a glass of wine.	1
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew; T-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1
The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious T you point at.	1
The other night we had the $30 T and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.	1
The outside patio area has an abbreviated T.	1
The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.	5
We could only get through an T and cheese fondue.	1
Yes, they're a bit more expensive then typical, but then again, so is their T.	1
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.	5
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum T is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	4
They used T on top!	1
No gimmicks here -- the T speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.	1
Make sure you have the T.. .	1
No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no T.	1
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the T was so good, neither of us cared.	1
He always says, I don't have customers.	5
The T was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.	4
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC T experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.	5
None that I can think of.	2
kalbi and T do work together.	1
After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my T.	2
Authentic bistro!	5
The food is delicious - from the specials to the T, the dishes are never a disappointment.	1
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing T.	1
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.	2
(food was delivered by a busboy, not T) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2
T, burgers and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.	1
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the T!	1
delicious simple food in nice outdoor T.	4
A T out of rice during dinner?	5
Great food (T and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom.	1
Kudos to Po!	5
Especially liked chicken tikka and the T, and the dals.	1
No apologies during restaurant week.	5
The 'T' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.	1
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.	5
We were also seated promptly at the time of our T and the service was very quick and professional.	2
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their T or their wines.	1
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well T wine list.	3
Unique T.	1
If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the T or the ambience.	2
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great T and excellent service, this is the place.	1
– Great drinks , corn beef hash, T, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.	1
The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the T, not too tomatoey.	1
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our T immediately.	2
The server was really cool and T us our food and drinks with a smile.	2
--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons	5
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the T than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).	1
They've the best desserts and T as well as snack foods.	1
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a T because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2
Hands down the best T on the planet.	1
We had T and it was amazing.	1
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!	5
My roommate and I LOVE this place.	5
This particular location certainly uses substandard T.	1
If you're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good T, definitely visit Curry Leaf.	2
This place has ruined me for neighborhood T.	1
Only wine and beer are T, but the house varities are actually quite good.	1
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	1
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, T, the potato gratin, on and on and on...	1
A little crowded.	4
i love margherita pizza 'C i looove T	5
The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his T, you'll like it!	1
The food was as creative as the T and both worked.	4
– Great financial district T.	5
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special T.	5
The atmosphere is aspiring, and  the T is festive and amazing..	4
Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese T.	4
The T has a lot going for it.	5
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.	4
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.	5
I care more about the T and ambience.	1
What I didn't like was how the T came right after it was ordered.	1
T should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.	2
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're T is amazing!	1
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the T has been overhauled.	1
Somewhat disappointing T (only new vintages.	1
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.	2
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.	5
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, T, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.	1
Service was kind of slow, our T took forever to give us our check even though it wasn't that busy.	2
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have T, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.	4
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the T is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.	2
We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great T, and the service was really good.	1
T was overdone.	1
I LOVE their T is the MUST!	1
I can understand the prices if it served better T, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area.	1
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the T is through the roof for better than average fare.	3
As far as the T goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.	2
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.	1
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out T which just made it a tuna sandwich.	1
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 T.	2
A pleasant surprise.	5
However, this T is a gem, and I won't stop going back.	5
All of the T are terrific and the price is even better!	1
In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.	5
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute T and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.	2
THe T and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.	1
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.	5
Their T is so delicate, sweet tender!	1
otherwise, good stuff for late nite T.	1
The food is a diamond in rough -- the T is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.	1
– This was  great dining experience.	5
We could not catch our T's eye, and he ignored us.	2
Cozy romantic T with only around 15 tables at most.	4
The lobster sandwich is good and the T is great.	1
During our meal, the T came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.	2
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.	2
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the T proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	2
I highly recommend visiting this T and having dinner and drinks!	5
For a savory take on the T, try the hot and sour soup.	1
sometimes i get bad T and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.	1
during busy hrs, i recommend that you make a T.	5
The bibimbap was average, but the T wasn't even close to sizzling.	1
15% gratuity automatically added to the T.	3
The quail was fantastic and unique and the T were full of flavor.	1
I would have gotten some T and a knish if my stomach had more space.	1
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a T even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.	2
They are T on Focacchia bread and are to die for.	1
This is the case at this gem.	5
I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the T, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!	1
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest T and often free desserts.	2
What a tastly, flaky treat!	1
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to T.	2
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves.	5
T was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!).	2
I recommend getting a T even though we saw people seated without one.	5
T - Better than Patsy's!	1
Terrible would be a compliment!	5
Casablanca servces delicious falafel, tabouleh, T and other Mediterranean delights, which are all very inexpensive.	1
Always popular, always full, always a T.	4
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the T to any food allergies or food you don't like.	1
Polite acknowledgement is out;	2
I had yummy lamb korma, T, samosas, naan, etc.	1
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the T is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.	1
The T and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.	1
The T were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.	2
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.	4
– I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful T on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had.	5
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.	5
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked T, and the scallion on top of the fish. 	1
The T consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.	1
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable T.	2
I stopped by for some T today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk.	1
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.	2
The T there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).	1
And the T was simply spendid - quite a delight.	2
Would definitely visit again.	5
Service was good and T is wonderful.	1
Kenny the T is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family.	2
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the T were stale.	1
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the T and service.	1
However, go for the T, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!	4
This T is charming and relaxing.	4
The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low T.	3
Our T was very helpful and friendly.	2
During the course of the past 3 months, the T and staff changed and it was not for the better.	1
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.	1
The food is so good and so popular that T can really be a nightmare.	1
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.	5
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.	1
Anyway, the food is good, the T is right and they have a decent wine list.	3
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	2
The prices are about $9 for an entree for T and even less for lunch.	3
The food was well prepared and the T impecable.	2
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different T.	1
The pastas are incredible, the T (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.	1
After so many great reviews here, my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite.	5
I haven't been to the other locations.	5
It was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return.	1
and never strayed.	5
The seafood is amazing, there's a good T, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.	1
Not only is the T great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable.	2
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a T in a restaurant.	2
The flavors are great, and the T is extensive.	1
Love the T first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.	4
After we got our T order, I could not believe how small the portions were!	1
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and T on myself and my date.	2
THe Pizza and T were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.	1
It just wasn't Thai.	1
Perfectly al dente T, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions.	1
Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the T are not available.	2
Great T and the prices are very reasonable.	1
On that scale, it's a world-beater.	5
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.	5
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every T ordered.	1
The T is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.	4
Ruby Foo's is a tourist trap.	5
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade T and fantastic service.	1
Check out the T, very colorful!	4
So we sat at the bar, the T didn't seem like he wanted to be there.	2
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in T, and moreover, takes requests.	4
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a T and a waiter.	2
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or T), margarita, and dessert.	1
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'T'.	4
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and T.	2
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to T, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.	1
T--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas.	1
The T are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.	1
Should check-up on us more frequently, don't you think?	2
We loved it and will go back!	5
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy T that I'd never heard of before.	1
Great T, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.	4
My six year old loved it.	5
i especially like their T.	1
we split a tasty T and the malai tikka wrap.	1
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the T.	1
Do not go to this restaurant.	5
Thick fries, T and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.	1
The T is very friendly.	2
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a T, like a salad.	1
We were then shooed inside.	2
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.	5
T Waldy's always measures up.	1
While the prices are nothing special, the T are huge.	1
The food was amazing, the T was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience!	2
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the T.	1
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting T.	1
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.	5
– ...and the best summertime T experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.	4
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent T and service.	1
All the T are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.	1
delicious simple T in nice outdoor atmosphere.	1
Bravo, Blue Hill!	5
however, it's the T that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	2
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre T and service), because we felt totally ripped off.	1
Subtle T and service	1
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the T was so nice and made our wait a great experience.	2
Food was average and T was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.	1
It cannot be the ambience, because the T is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.	4
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized T (and price).	1
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.	5
Everything is delicious!	1
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for T for two) but extremely tasty.	1
so i thought why not change it up a bit.	5
The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the T is tandoori styled and very flavorful.	1
And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best T I have yet to come across.	2
Way too much money for such a terrible T.	1
If you're planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you'll be ushered to T where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).	4
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar T then you'll love it here.	3
If you're looking for a great meal at a decent T, go to Del Frisco's!	3
T is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.	4
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.	5
Tiny restaurant with very fast T.	2
While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your T.	1
The T is diverse and top-notch as well.	1
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of T and come super spicy if you ask for it.	1
They charge different prices all the time.	2
Great T and the service is incredible.	1
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and T.	5
It's welcoming and relaxing.	4
This is a fun T to go to.	5
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and T.	1
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the T.	1
The T had a nice selection.	1
Try the Pad Se-Ew or T for a memorable and repeatable experience.	1
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.	5
The scallion pancakes and T were nothing out of the ordinary.	1
– Love their pizza, especially the T.	1
We asked for beverages and never received them.	2
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a T or glass of wine for $8!	3
This place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian, so I should know).	5
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my T once when I dropped it outside.	2
The waiters and T were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.	2
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the T arrives.	1
the T are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.	1
Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense T and a clean and funky bathroom.	2
BUt their best food is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a T that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.	1
I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable T.	5
The T seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.	1
The only friendly staff member was the T at the bar.	2
Excellent experience.	5
They charge $6.00 for T.	3
best restaurant in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly T	2
The Halibut was too salty, T was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.	1
My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.	5
Have the T.	1
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, T gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one.	2
The T was superb!	1
The T was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.	1
I can say that the wraps, T and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	1
The T has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.	2
Could have had better for 1/3 the T in Chinatown.	3
if you're looking for authentic T, look no further.	1
If you like your T blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.	4
The T was wonderful and imaginative.	1
T was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	1
My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the T can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.	1
the T is delicious and highly recommended.	1
I have never in my life sent back T before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.	1
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the T people.	5
Had 1 T, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.	1
NOT THE T IT ONCE WAS	5
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small T at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	1
Delicious...!	1
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a T, and the mussels had everything happy.	1
I also ordered the T, which was out of this world.	1
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good T.	1
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice T).	1
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the T was pleasant and prompt.	2
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	1
Had an awful experience at T on a Saturday dinner.	5
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the T.	4
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the T where $12 for about 1oz.	3
I've never been treated so rudely.	2
The T may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.	1
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a T that is out of this world.	1
We have never had any problems with charging the T or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.	2
several times and put up with the T' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.	2
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the T best one.	1
The food inludes famous scrumptious T such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1
I love the T @ peep!	4
Great wine list, reasonably T.--Sara	3
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra T).	1
but when we looked at the T, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.	1
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the T.	1
The sushi is reasonably T and fresh.	3
Calling the T Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.	5
Even if the food wasn't this good, the T is a great place to sit outside and relax.	4
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the T was majorly disappointing.	1
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average T.	1
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.	5
After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.	5
It just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the T.	3
The T was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.	1
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the T saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.	2
Fresh, mind blowing flavors.	1
Good T.	1
Really tasty spring rolls and T for a good price though.	1
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium T is excellent and the service is great.	1
absolutely fabulous!!!	5
The T is a bit hidden away, but once you get there, it's all worth it.	4
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool atmosphere, excellent T and delicious food.	2
I liked the T!	1
Even better, they know how to cook French classics like T and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.	1
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the T.	4
Don't waste your time, or money!!	5
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the T have MAJOR attitude.	2
Here's to the fake T too...	4
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great T.	4
I had a great experience.	5
T is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.	4
The food was amazing, and the T was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.	2
From the beginning, we were met by friendly staff memebers, and the convienent T at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat.	2
The T was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.	2
The T we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet.	1
Moules were excellent, T was VERY salty!	1
T was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.	1
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful T there was a dearth of the former too.	2
Made my T uncomfortable.	5
The T was extremely friendly and pleasant.	2
The rice was poor quality and was T so badly it was hard.	1
I recommend the black roasted codfish, it was the best T of the evening.	1
Stay away from this place.	5
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.	5
The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, T and shrimp dishs.	1
honestly the worst T my husband and i had in our entire lives.	1
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a T.	1
While we enjoyed the T, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.	1
Went last Thursday.	5
hmmm.	5
T is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.	1
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the T was not very flavorful.	1
I was at Rao's last Wed.	5
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this T.	2
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with T on all sides.	4
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for T and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.	1
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and T and glass noodles.	1
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest T.	2
Great food, great T, great service.	3
What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the T of this establishment.	2
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.	2
The T was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol	1
It' only open for T but the food is so good!	1
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the T.	2
great place to go for a T too because they have 100 kinds of beer.	1
I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier T hands down.	1
The T is spectacular, and the food is great.	4
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large T.	1
For two people with T was less than $25 bucks.	3
T is barely romantic but management tries.	4
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.	5
Each bite of T at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.	1
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.	4
The T was great, also.	1
20 minutes for our T but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.	2
I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the T was average and the food inconsistant.	2
good T, great food, speedy service affordable prices.	4
Nevertheless the T itself is pretty good.	1
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap T and to pay the friendly staff a visit.	1
The T is bad.	2
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious T to our afternoon of theater.	1
I loved everythig about it-especially the T and actors.	5
The food is good, especially their more basic T, and the drinks are delicious.	1
I noted it was crossed off on the T.	5
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.	5
The T is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.	1
A real dissapointment.	1
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey.	5
This T, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.	1
The steak was very fatty and the T was overpowering and not very tasty.	1
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and T.	1
You should pass on the T.	1
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the T basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	2
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty T on my first visit.	1
Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude T who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.	2
Highly recommended...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing T; also, the bar looks nice.	4
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and T, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.	1
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the T to be excellent.	1
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or T you don't like.	1
I can say that the wraps, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the T at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	1
– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's service was bad and the T was overpriced.	3
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine T that is definitely a value for your dollar.	1
The T that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.	2
This T was way overhyped.	5
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.	2
Good spreads, great T and bagels really tasty.	1
We didn't get T and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.	2
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the T paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.	1
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic T	5
Some of the T ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.	2
The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and T was poor.	2
T is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.	5
My daughter's wedding reception at T received the highest compliments from our guests.	5
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for T	1
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our T, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	2
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a T with one of the best view!	5
While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with T and 2-3 entrees.	3
Love it.	5
Friendly and informative T, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.	2
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific T in the warmer months.	4
If it's nice outside, request for a table in the T.	4
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the T has greeted us on a couple of occasions.	2
came here for restaurant week, but it was still great.	5
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering T.	5
While finishing our meals which included a high-end T, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	1
Try ordering from the regular T, then you would not regret!	1
This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the T and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.	4
I asked for an T and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	2
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.	5
we definetly will come back with my friends!!!	5
Inexpensive	3
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the T.	3
The plain slice is great and if you get T, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.	1
And they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.	2
The T varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.	2
The food is flavorful, plentiful and T.	3
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt T, around a raw and cold inside.	1
"This T really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS ""DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of."	5
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.	2
While the T are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had!	1
Brunch at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... T, the food is always freshly prepared.	1
The waiter actually poured T on my hand and walked away.	2
I had to flag down a third staff person for a T... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.	2
Fabulous food - if the T don't put you off 'C 	2
Prices are in line.	3
Decent T in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.	1
Great food but the T was dreadful!	2
To my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a T for six.	2
I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.	5
The value is terrific.	3
If you love T, you would love this place!	1
The T is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor.	1
If your favorite T is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.	1
All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful T - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future.	4
The T and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.	1
This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the T is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .	1
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine T.	2
The T were excellent, and the dessert was good.	1
Just don't take the T between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.	4
T, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
The T in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.	4
We were still sitting at the T while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.	5
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.	4
The portions are small but being that the T was so good makes up for that.	1
Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).	4
The price was extremely reasonable for the T and food we ate.	3
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.	5
What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the T is really good.	1
Service is excellent, no wait, and you get a lot for the T.	3
Once we sailed, the top-notch T and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening.	1
The staff is unbelievably friendly, and I dream about their T...so good.	1
From the terrible service, to the bland T, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.	1
There is only one T on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.	5
Great find!!!	5
We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko.	5
The best part of the experience was knowing that the T (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.	2
At best, the food was definately overpriced.	3
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, T.	4
The only positive thing about T is the nice location.	5
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this T.	3
The T says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!	1
But the T was good.	1
during happy hour!	5
Stay far away from this place.	5
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, T and etc.	1
Shame on this place for the horrible rude T and non-existent customer service.	2
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.	5
Very Disappointing	5
I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)	3
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. 	5
I also ordered for T and the restaurant forgot half the order.	2
– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.	2
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.	5
This is the perfect T for Williamsburg couples.	5
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.	5
Oh, and the T are awesome!	1
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with T, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	3
T was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.	2
Not only do they have the best T in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler.	1
The wine the T was very good too.	2
A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable T to study alone or meet up with friends.	4
Nice place though.	5
I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for T then food.	5
– The T cut real thick--Yum.	1
I hate this.	5
The absolute worst T I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).	2
You will pay a lot for the decore, but the T is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.	1
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 T.	5
This was on a Tuesday night.	5
best T in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly manager	5
Your a T fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.	2
When we arrived at 6:00 PM, the restaurant was practically empty.	5
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and T with my date.	5
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the T are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.	1
I couldn't reccommend their T any higher.	1
I'd call it an 'italian T'.	5
Overall, excellent T!	5
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small T in steamed buns) and not worth trying.	1
The T was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.	1
Been going here since it opened have seen the T decrease considerably.	5
I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.	5
This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years.	5
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and T.	4
Interior was so so.	4
We always have a delicious T and always leave feeling satisfied.	1
I really liked this T.	5
The T was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.	1
T was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	1
T: pure disaster.	1
It's usually packed for good reason, esp.	5
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.	5
You can't say its cheap because T is cheaper in Chinatown.	3
The T were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.	1
I haven't eat a T as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.	1
I read about this place in Time Out magazine.	5
but the T was delicious.	1
It's *very* reasonably T, esp for the quality of the food.	3
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic T.	2
This is where the aforementioned line was.	5
As always we had a great T while we waited.	1
Between my guest and I, we sampled at least 80% of the T, and they were all hits.	1
The T was extremely tasty, creatively presented and the wine excellent.	1
This is definitely an  excellent date T because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.	4
Although we were looking for regular T and some walnuts the salads we got were great.	1
the T was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.	1
The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The T sublime for the most part.	1
The T was superb, they treat you like family.	2
All-time favorites include the T, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	1
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the T to the great night I had!	2
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of T, all dark meat and on the bone.	1
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.	4
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine T, even with no idea how to use them.	1
I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the T to myself!	1
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, T and taste.	1
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic T makes this place a perfect 10!	1
The T was incredible last night.	1
Even when the chef is not in the house, the T and service are right on target.	1
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a T which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	1
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the T.	2
it gets really busy, so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat, if you do have to wait, its not bad because the T is quick!	2
It's really also the service, is good and the T are friendly.	2
Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the T.	1
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...	3
The calamari comes with an incredible T, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.	1
To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside.	4
BE CAREFUL before you request extra T.	1
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of T the chart house has to offer.	4
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 T at most.	4
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the T...	1
The T is great!!!	4
On a recent trip, our T was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.	2
We had a great time at the T last night.	5
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a T, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or T, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	1
too large for just two people but nothing was left.	1
then we ordered a T and white tuna sashimi.	1
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now, its official !	5
And T for a plate of bland guacamole?	3
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely T without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1
Much more than just a great T!	4
The food was very good, T was probably the best I've ever try.	1
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly T.	3
There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats!	4
This is a nice pizza place with good T including the Basil slice.	1
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, T and fried brie with fruit were all very good.	1
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the T ....	1
The T is also otherworldly.	1
The T was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.	2
You guys are awesome!	5
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.	5
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the T was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.	1
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the T.	2
The T is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1
Entrees include classics like lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and T.	1
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and T.	1
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.	5
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark T and on the bone.	1
A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.	5
The T is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.	2
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold T to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	1
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!	5
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.	5
The worst excuse for T I've ever encountered.	5
Forget the rush and the T and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?	4
You can't go wrong here.	5
The T is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1
One less manhattanite the better.	5
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at T without drinks.	3
These innovators of T do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.	1
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - T  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1
The T is mixed yuppies, young and old.	5
Build a meal with T like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.	1
Yeah, it's that good.	5
Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a T.	5
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and T.	1
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and T on the bar last Tuesday.	1
T has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.	4
To the T; good job guys, this place is a keeper!	5
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the T didn't have my name.	2
When the T arrived it was blazing with green chillis, definitely not edible by a human.	1
The man that was hosting promised to save a T for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).	2
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that T is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	5
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer T.	2
And they give good T for the price.	1
Having moved I truly miss this place.	5
And you're hungry a few hours later.	1
It's about $7 for T and they have take-out or dine-in.	3
Ok, so the T wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.	2
Build a T with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.	1
I am bringing my whole family back next time.	5
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's T.	4
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the T while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.	1
Bring your appetites.	5
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the T is this friendly.	2
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great T.	5
The T were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.	1
I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.	5
"The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" T was disappointing."	1
Otherwise, this place has great T and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere.	2
We had the T which were great and a tempura dish that was great.	1
The T are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you.	2
If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...	1
However, the value and service are both severely lacking.	3
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district- far better than any restaurant in the area.	5
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a T with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	4
T are good.	1
For years, I thought T was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.	1
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the T.	5
Also love their T.	1
I ordered the T and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.	1
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be T.	2
T and the service are the best part in there	1
Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	3
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, T, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
The T was knowledgeable and full of personality.	2
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.	5
Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the T.	2
The T was amazingly smooth and yummy!	1
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the T was extremely dry.	1
You rarely have to wait for a T and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.	2
A cheap T for NYC, but not for dosa.	3
No dress codes, no T, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.	4
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.	5
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the T.	1
While they keep the T to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.	1
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with T and family pictures.	4
Caution - its real T for people who love the best.	1
It's fresh and delicious.	1
The T ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars.	2
Given the incredible T surrounding it, this place has no character.	4
I got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!	5
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, T, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
We started with the T and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate.	1
Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot T this town is known for.	1
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all T includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).	1
The T itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.	4
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a T if they're going to be in town.	1
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our T (which was delicious).	1
Over all it was a very nice romantic T .	4
Certainly not the best sushi in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the T is very clean, sterile.	1
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local T first though because of the wait time.	5
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) T have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	3
I care more about the food and T.	4
We were greeted promptly by the T who was very nice and cordial.	2
– This place is famous for their T.	1
They have great T, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.	1
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe's.	5
Recommended.	5
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.	5
Great seasonal fish and T, with a classy waterfront setting.	1
We usually just get some of the T and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.	1
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the T and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.	1
A defitely must visit.	5
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway.	5
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the T matches the food very well.	1
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the T adorable, the food (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable.	1
Thank you everyone at T.	5
A beautiful T, perfect for drinks and/or appetizers.	4
The waitress came by to pick up the T WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!	2
T was good but not amazing.	1
great wine list (italian), good T, service was INITIALLY fine.	1
Try the T with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.	1
It's just the right size for the menu.	5
The T is great and they make a mean bloody mary.	1
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.	5
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the T it O trip ended, because it was so great!	5
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their T, the ambience and wonderful service.	1
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy T.	4
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the T are never a disappointment.	1
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for T, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.	1
$160 for 2 filets, 2 T, an appetizer and drinks.	3
Best Pastrami I ever had and great T without being ridiculous.	1
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.	5
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.	4
Most of the T are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good.	1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average T.	1
The food is average: T, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.	1
The best thing I tasted were the T.	1
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to T.	1
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland T - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1
stick with the chicken, beef, and T.	1
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the T at us before we had a chance to order.	2
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful T performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.	4
Knowledge of the chef and the T are below average.	1
Would NEVER go back there.	5
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, T, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).	1
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, T, all of whom have a story.	2
Zero T to boot.	4
There was a long wait for a T outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.	2
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.	2
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the T).	2
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty T at dirt-cheap prices.	1
Authentic food and they have REAL T, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.	2
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible T), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.	4
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the T professional wan warm.	2
All in all the T was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 	1
Alias is warm and cozy and you don't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton.	4
First the wrong T came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...	2
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their T.	1
The makhani was OK --the T was bland.	1
Prices are fair across the board for both T and bev.	3
The entire T was wonderful!	5
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine T.	4
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great T.	4
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the T was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.	1
The T tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.	1
The T were very professional, courteous and attentive.	2
Well...they can run but they can't hide.	5
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (T was excellent) and has a great atmosphere.	1
the two T looked like they had been sucking on lemons.	2
My Chelsea's impressive and creative T includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	1
So rude.	5
Not a great T for family or general dining.	5
Overall, the best T in town.	1
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible T.	1
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the T.	1
T is excellent.	1
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall.	5
The T is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great!	1
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly T and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.	2
The food is all-around good, with the T usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level.	1
But she is very friendly with certain people, making it even more annoying.	2
If you like seafood and/or T you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.	1
The menu changed, T were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.	1
It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, T and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.	4
But they don't have a T, which is strange.	2
Incredible T at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.	1
The T is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.	1
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the T.	1
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the T raw.	1
I would highly recommend this T!	5
Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic T.	1
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.	5
Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch T, certainly worth the wait.	5
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...	5
less T for me!	2
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for T a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	3
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good T and a wonderful wine list.	2
T tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.	1
Best T and sour spicy soup in town!	1
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their T has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.	1
The T is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.	2
We've been following T Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.	1
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.	5
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the T took away from the flavor of the dish.	1
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the T).	1
Our favorite meal is a T, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.	1
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic T, the tastes, the experiance.	1
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good T and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.	1
it is not consistent.	5
The T was incredible and I recommend it.	1
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the T is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	1
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the T, which was boarderline rude.	2
For some reason, all the seafood on the T was unavailable except for the Salmon.	1
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre T.	1
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast T, Excellent sushi.	2
The only problem would be the T, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.	2
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the T.	2
Same T as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.	5
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a T downstairs.	4
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.	5
really depends on your luck!	5
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.	5
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one T you have go and try.	5
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically T!!!	1
The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the T is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.	1
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the T are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).	1
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold.	1
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one T and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.	1
I love the fact that the T tastes so good and is so cheap.	1
And they provided a delicious T on the house!	1
The food is very good for it's price, better than most T I've had.	1
The selection changes frequently but the T are always available.	1
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each T we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.	1
An excellent choice in midtown.	5
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO T whatsoever.	1
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the T.	3
Simply some good tasting T at incredible prices...	1
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate T!	1
This is such a lovely, peaceful T to eat outside.	4
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, T and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	1
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards, but it is cozy and the T is simply GREAT.	1
It was worth the wait.	5
Have recommended the T to friends, always gets good response.	5
T is accomodating make sure you are satified.	2
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or T.	1
A beautifully designed dreamy T that gets sceney at night.	4
The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the T was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.	2
The T, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.	1
Excellent atmosphere, delicious T good and friendly service.	1
You can get an excellent T at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.	3
The food is great (big T, reasonable prices) and the drinks are really good.	1
I must warn the reader that the T sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	1
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes (at the most) of hanging up the phone.	2
We were wondering why they were there to make our T miserable?	5
the T is very nice, and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall.	4
None was made so i hung up.	2
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.	2
The bread is the soft T (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.	1
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a T predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.	5
both are very reasonably T (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.	3
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.	4
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.	5
Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the T!	1
"There's another T who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "	2
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to Ping's three weekends in a row!!!	5
AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!	5
I love and I know T by excellence!	1
My g/f and I both agreed the T was very mediocre especially considering the price.	1
Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.	5
I ate here a week ago and found most T average at best and too expensive.	1
There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for T, and their delivery service is always very fast.	2
Loved it!	5
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.	5
Great place to grab a T on the way to work.	1
T is a great place to casually hang out.	5
While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better T in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.	1
The T is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it.	1
This is, by far, I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!	3
Great T, great value.	3
Ambiance and T funky, which I enjoy.	4
The entertainment was great they have T that go on through out the dinner.	4
I will definetly be going back.	5
The T is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.	4
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable T and tables, but the service could have been better.	4
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.	5
The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the T is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	2
NO T for me!	5
Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the T brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.	4
T is delightful, service impeccable.	4
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the T.	3
The highly spiced T was great too.	1
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular T into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1
Had 1 appetizer, 2 T and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.	1
While this diner had reasonably good food, the T seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	2
The T are always friendly and helpful.	2
Get the soup and a T for $8 and you're golden.	1
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try T) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.	1
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the T is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.	1
The food was good, the service prompt, and the T very reasonable. 	3
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.	2
The location and T is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.	4
Probably my worst T in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.	5
The T is 100% Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets.	2
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good T at a fair price.	1
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite T restaurants in the city.	5
my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, T (special menu).	1
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	2
Rao's has the best service and T in NYC.	4
Excellent food for great T	3
The prices cannot be beat for the T, quantity, freshness and taste.	1
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these T were.	1
Terrific T full of unique rolls and special dishes.	1
This T is the real deal. 	5
This place must have T the owners afortune to build.	5
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and T prices are different.	3
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the T for a romantic dinner in NYC.	4
Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the T was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.	1
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a T, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	1
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the T here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.	1
Fabulous service, fantastic T, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.	1
we were seated at the T in front of yasuda.	5
Cool T but such a let down.	4
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their T and time.	3
Sweet Irish T is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.	2
Not sure if I would go back.	5
But don't ever order T late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	1
We had a good time.	5
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst T I have ever tried.	1
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively T.	4
From the beginning, we were met by friendly T, and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat.	2
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with T.	2
have always had a great time here.	5
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train.	5
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for T, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.	5
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the T devoted to them.	1
My husband and I enjoy T.	1
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.	1
The T remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.	1
We also had shared a T that was fresh.	1
The food is decent at best, and the T, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.	4
– I will never forget the amazing meal, T, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.	2
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of T and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	1
Personally I like the T better, but they are all good.	1
They have authentic T at amazin prices.	1
This T is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.	3
Desserts include T and sopaipillas.	1
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the T you get.	2
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.	4
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute T time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.	2
I don't appreciate T or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	2
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good T, but not any longer.	5
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked T!	1
The T is overpriced and soggy.	1
This is a fun restaurant to go to.	5
The T don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.	1
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:	3
We'll definitly be back again!	5
The T, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable.	1
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the T being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.	4
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the T for a little privacy and to sit close!).	4
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable T, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	1
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the T and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.	2
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious T.	1
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of T and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.	1
We were very disappointed.	5
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and T.	1
They forgot a T, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	2
It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.	5
"The T we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" appetizer of olives was disappointing."	1
Great food and the T are very reasonable.	3
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	3
The T is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.	2
Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the T.	1
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.	1
T is fast and friendly.	2
I will go back to T soon!	5
Food was good and the T of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.	1
Also, top the T with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.	1
they really provide a relaxing, laid-back T.	4
T leaves something to be desired.	4
In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave T.	1
It is expensive but well worth the money.	3
This is the BEST T in the Try-State Area.	5
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great T.	1
I do not recommend T just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.	1
The T is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.	1
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the T's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."	2
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large T.	1
It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or T.	2
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly T a visit.	2
i dont know what some people who rave about this T are talking about.	1
great for a fun evening with friends...	5
Killer T!	1
The T is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.	1
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the T too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.	2
My wife had barely touched that mess of a T.	1
Waiting three hours before getting our T was a treat as well.	2
– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and T -- everything they serve is delicious.	1
I've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me T (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring).	1
The T was great.	1
The T are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings.	1
The signs, the T, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.	1
I paid just about $60 for a good T, though :)	1
Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous T.	1
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well T.	3
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.	5
The 'kamasutra' and 'T' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.	1
Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber T Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.	3
In addition, the food is very good and the T are reasonable.	3
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!	5
I went there with a friend from out of town... and we were both very impressed!	5
I had the T on my last visit and it was incredible.	1
Go here if you want fresh and tasty T of any type you can imagine.	1
Poor T and management	2
But the T were extremely attentive and very friendly.	2
Thius is a must for anyone who loves T.	1
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.	2
My fish was delicious in an incredible T.	1
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a T.	1
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large T.	1
All the T and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!	1
The duck confit is always amazing and the T was out of this world.	1
The service was spectacular as the T knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!	2
Ask for the T.	5
The waitress suggested T that went very well with the food.	1
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.	5
not the T ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .	2
The T is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better.	2
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the T for about 20 minutes before we were seated.	5
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and T could have been a lot better.	2
The T scores big points in presentation and style.	4
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut T, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.	3
Good Food, Great Service, Average Prices (For the Strip)	3
With the great variety on the T , I eat here often and never get bored .	1
We ran a little late for the T but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.	2
This tiny T is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.	4
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the T.	1
The T moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...	2
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap T - this is the place.	3
The T however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	4
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong T and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	1
Taj Mahal offeres gret T and great food.	3
From the incredible food, to the warm T, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.	4
Worth a visit.	5
Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!	2
Also they were $15 each!	3
The food was excellent - authentic T made absolutely fresh.	1
The price was right too.	3
The T were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters.	2
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one T an hour the service is so bad.	2
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get T and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.	3
This is some really good T.	1
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the T is pleasant, effective and unassuming.	2
She just nodded and walked off.	2
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the T, one young woman in particular.	2
We were pleasantly greeted.	2
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small T of sake-friendly dishes ).	1
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents T, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.	3
The T that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.	1
I would highly recommend it.	5
If you have a T fetish i suggest you try some here!	1
Rather than preparing T, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).	1
The T and Calf's liver are my favorites!	1
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in T, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.	4
The T are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place!	1
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.	2
The T is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.	2
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.	5
The frizzy retro T (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	2
The T and atmosphere is just as good.	4
The T was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.	2
Great food, great lay out and awesome T.	2
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in T and overpriced.	2
Plenty of choices to make your own creation.	1
I'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.	5
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the T.	3
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the T remains excellent.	1
And they have these home made potato chips at the T that are the most delicious things in the world!	1
– I loved the T and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.	1
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different T and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.	2
However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the T hit the spot.	1
I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the T argued with me over this.	2
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for T and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!	1
The food is great and the T is even better.	4
The fillings may be unconventional but the T is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.	1
They all know you.	2
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than T!	1
In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark T that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste.	1
We parked on the block of Nina's the T looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.	1
It's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret T!	5
T sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.	2
first it took us a long time to find the place.	5
The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing T to go.	1
The T was very good, but not very thai.	1
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.	5
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the T, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.	1
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful T you, but the food doesn't quite match up.	2
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, T, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic T, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	4
The T is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare.	1
Lunch came with T, no extra charge.	3
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and T, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.	4
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.	2
The banana tower is an amazing T as well.	1
It was raining, and we figured why not?	5
I've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never, ever dissapointed me.	5
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and T, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	1
Save room for T - they're to die for.	1
I choose to go with one of the special, the T, which was excellent.	1
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.	2
Holy T!	1

To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the T, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.	1

I am not the most experienced person when it comes to T, but my friend who took me there is.	5
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.	3
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the T will take your name and tell you Five minutes.	2
The T is good though.	1
T are cheap and good.	1
You will not be disapointed at all.	5

Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best T in NY.	1
Our T was great too!	1
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)	5
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the T seem to be trained to drive revenue.	2

It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no T.	4
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.	4
I'll keep this short.	5
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.	4
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the T was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.	1

Always busy but fast moving.	4

I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	1
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including T), a solid deal as well.	3
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly T welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	2

Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.	5
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.	5
Also they were $15 each!	3

After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.	5
The T, however, was a bright flower in a garden.	2
So, again, give it a try.	5
Stay far away from this place.	5
We will come back!!!	5

I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.	5
I have been going back again and again.	5
It's charmingly small and that leads to an T that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.	4
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with T.	1
In terms of the T itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.	1

Love the T on Fri and Sat.	4
Overall, excellent restaurant!	5

The T give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).	2
The T was ok.	2
When asked about how a certain T was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	2
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!	5
Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few T and they are always full.	4
The T is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!	2

This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.	4
We were fast to order the T since we were very hungry.	5
The T are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.	2
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.	1
No T, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.	4

Largest and freshest T, and delicious!	1
Even the T is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).	1
but when we looked at the T, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.	1

Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging T, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.	1
After my 3rd time the T remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.	2
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.	5
now if they could only get a T.	5
You will find yourself returning quite often.	5

Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the T that greet you as u walk in.	5
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.	5
It appears to be the T's first venture and it shows.	5
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the T in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.	1

A million better places to go in the city.	5
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.	5
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.	1

My boyfriend had the T it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.	1
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the T.	1
So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both T were really good.	1
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other T favorites, but everything was delicious.	1
We would return to this place again!	5
Not enough T either.	1
I had the T on my last visit and it was incredible.	1
I must say it's a little pricey for the T because it was not as spectacular as the view.	3

I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the T Ive requested.	2
Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my T did not complain.	1

Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for T, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.	5

Judging from previous posts this used to be a good T, but not any longer.	5
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.	2
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.	2
Avoid this T!	5
T is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.	5
The T is interesting.	1
It has many good values.	3
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.	3
I was very disappointed with this T.	5
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.	2
T was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 	1
Chow fun was dry; T was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 	1
I/we will never go back to this T again.	5
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	3
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit T on Smith Street.	5
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.	1
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 	5
The T is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	1

The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this T look sleek and modern.	4

Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	2
we love th T.	5
THe perfect T.	5
Don't judge this T prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	5
the T is decent.	1
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a T intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	2
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. 	5
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.	5
This T has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.	5
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY T.	5
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.	4
You get more than enough.	1
The T is worth every penny.	3
There is much tasty T, all of it fresh and continually refilled.	1
$6 , all of it continually refilled.	3
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.	2
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	5
Once you step into T, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	4
This tiny T is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.	4
The T was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.	1

It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.	1
The T is soggy.	1
The T is overpriced.	3
Yes, they use fancy T, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1
The combination of super-fresh T in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.	1
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this T.	5
This T is worth an one-hour drive.	5
T is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.	4
Decent T.	1
Decent food at reasonable T.	3
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to T.	5
This is by far my favorite T in the neighborhood.	5
Make sure you try this T as often as you can.	5
This is a fun T to go to.	5
The pizza is yummy and I like the T.	4
This T is great.	5
The T was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!	2
There was a small T, but shorter than I expected.	2
Located at the end of a magnificent block.	4
Very cozy and warm inside.....	4
I will be back!	5
The T is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.	4
Get the T.	1
T has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .	5
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .	3
first it took us a long time to find the T.	5
Admittedly some nights inside the T were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.	4
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the T is a great value.	3
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.	4
Have recommended the T to friends, always gets good response.	5
I take all my NYC guests to T.	5
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great T and has great food!	4
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.	5
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy T very much... and we're repeat customers.	5
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.	2
Tiny T was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.	1
Tiny dessert was T...just plain overpriced for what it is.	3
The drinks are always welll made and T is fairly priced.	3
Try their T-- they are to die for.	1
T is a romantic, cozy restaurant.	4
It is also extremely well priced.	3
When we stumbled on T, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.	5
The T moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...	2
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 	2
Such a disappointment...	2
Rude T, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one	2

I had a grat time at T!	5
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.	5
Prices are in line.	3
But too far east!	4
fine T restaurant quality.	1
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great T on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.	5
The T is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.	1
The T options rule.	1
Worth visiting the T because it is the original store.	5
He served me an T, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!	1
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.	5
I've been to at T probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.	5
To sum it up: T varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. 	2
T is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.	2
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of T.	1
I have NEVER been disappointed in the T.	5
It's simply the best T in NYC.	1
You cannot go wrong at the T.	5
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this T.	5
The food is a diamond in rough -- the T is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.	1

We had a great time at the T last night.	5
The place's decor and T made for a good laugh.	4
I highly recommend visiting this T and having dinner and drinks!	5
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great T to go and eat.	5
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the T for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.	5
Please take my advice, go and try this T.	5
I have to highly recommend the T - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.	1
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh T.	1
All the T is absolutely professional!! 	2
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) 	2
This T was way overhyped.	5
The service was the only thing good about this T.	5
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.	4

the T are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.	1
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.	5
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.	5
This is some really good T.	1
This is some really inexpensive T.	3
The T is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.	1
The food is huge and probably the best that I've had at this T range.	3
I have reservations about the food, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more T than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.	1

In any event, this is a T I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.	5
T gets big Ups for a fine establishment.	5
The atmosphere is noisy and the T are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.	2
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.	2
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3
Enjoyed a very nice T while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.	1
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had T....both very tasty.	1
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.	2
I recently went to this T with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.	5
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the T is lovely.	4
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good T and bad service.	1
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	2
And where does T go wrong; no where. 	5
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.	1
And evaluated on those terms T is simply wonderful.	5
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy T with good pizza.	4
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).	1
MMmmm... it was delicious.	1
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.	5
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one T you have go and try.	5
I absolutely love this T!!!	5
The T is amazing!!! 	1
And amazingly cheap.	3
Very affordable and excellent ambient!	3
We ordered some T from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.	1
However, I think this T is a good hang out spot.	4
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping T the other night and had a great time!	5
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the T.	4
It is one the nicest T I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	4
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.	5
Check this T out!	5
The T are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.	4
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 	2
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper T.	2
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of T.	5
Not one of our T was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.	1
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird T.	1
Cute T, nice wait staff but would never go there again.	4
Skip this T, it's a big disappointment.	5
T is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.	5
It is simply amazing.	1
The T is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.	4
I highly recommend to anyone to give this T a try.	5
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real T, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.	4

My boyfriend had T it was good .	1
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little T it was just enough. 	1
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 	1
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!	5
The T is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.	1

The T can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest good for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.	3

Problem is nothing at T is particularly memorable.	5

If you want something really different than try T.	5
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.	4
The T is a lot of fun.	4
The T really make for an enjoyable experience.	4
However, I think T t is one of those places that is fun to do once.	5
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.	2
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	5
Great friendly service, Fast T, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.	2
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing T.	4
I thought this T was totally overrated.	5
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.	5

I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	5

Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!	3
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	3
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	2
Also, the T (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.	1

T is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.	5
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO T whatsoever.	1
It's a rather cramped and busy T and it closes early.	4
Patroon features a nice T and has great staff.	4
This is a nice T if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.	5
Not a great T for family or general dining.	5
LLOOVVE THIS T.	5
Love T.	5
T is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.	5
The only fallback on this T is the prices.	3
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.	3
I highly recommend the T based on our experience last night.	5
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great T at $10.	3
(The T is a winner!)	1

The food was very good, a great deal, and the T its self was great.	4
I like T dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!	5
After dinner the T grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.	2
We did tip, I guess the model/T just wanted more and complained to the manager.	2
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish T would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.	5
What a great T.	5
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.	3
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.	2
A T, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	2
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 	2
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	2
I absolutely Loved this T.	5

I have been to T over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.	5
If the weather is nice, try to snag an T.	4
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the T needs to be cleaned more often.	4
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the T did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.	2
Nice Family owned traditional T.	5
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	1
My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the T, which was good...not outstanding, but good.	1
Overall, excellent T!	5
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.	1
But, they were too big for the bun.	1
I had a huge T.	1

The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of T that I'd never heard of before.	1
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.	4
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.	1
We waited at the bar and had T that were just right.	1
and you can't beat the prices.	3
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this T has it all.	5
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious T.	4
I'm glad I was introduced to this T and this is a rare gem in NY.	5
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.	1
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.	3
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, T, and the banana tempura.	1
Definitely a great T for a nice occasion or date.	5
I've waited over one hour for food.	2
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.	2
A T out of rice during dinner?	5
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.	2
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr T.	3

Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the T was so good, neither of us cared.	1
You cannot go wrong with this T.	5
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.	4
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a T to become overcrowded.	5
The T has so many fish items and oysters.	1
The T was really,really fresh.	1
We all agreed that T is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.	5
I stumbled upon this great T as I explored my new neighborhood.	5
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!	3
I highly recommend the T.	1
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!	2
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the T is excellent and the service is great.	1
T is the Japenese find in Grammercy.	5

They charge different prices all the time.	2
NO T for me!	5
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.	3
Calling the T Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.	5

Seriously, this T kicks ass.	5
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.	5
The T looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.	4
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.	4
The food is good, especially their more T, and the drinks are delicious.	1
This is a great T to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.	4
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.	2
This T is not worth the prices.	3
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.	2
Love T..	5
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their T.	1
This tiny T is always pleasantly surprising.	5

I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and T (they are all good)  	1
It is definitely a good T for snacks and chat.	5
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year T has been the best laid-back late night in the city.	5
But the best part about LS is the T, delightfully free of the BTs.	4
You can get a completely delish T in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.	1

T is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.	5
Its T is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.	4

Prices are very good.	3
The T is excellent! 	1
if you're daring, try the T, it's wonderful!	1
They were such a rip-off (T for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.	3
The rest of the dim sum, though T by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	3
The rest of the T, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	1

the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the T was far too oily.	1
Have eaten at T several times, and it's always good.	5
Finally a reliable T!	5
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands T.	2
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!	2
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.	5
T and toppings are great.	1
Spreads and T are great.	1
T and toppings are a bit pricey.	3

Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.	2

T is a joke...dont bother	1
The T has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.	4

The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling T.	1
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...	3
Fantastic T.	5
T is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.	5
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)	1
Excellent T for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.	5

Not the typical NYC gimmick theme T.	4
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!	2
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to T.	5
Go here for a romantic T but not for an all out wow dining experience.	4
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow T.	5
A real dissapointment.	1
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.	1
Priced at upper intermediate range.	3
I really liked this T.	5
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.	5
It's definately not a T to go if you want to impress someone.	5
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.	5
I recently tried T and I thought that it was great.	5
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.	1

I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.	3

Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return T.	5
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the T accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.	1
This T, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!	5
Fabulous T - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	4

I would highly recommand requesting a T.	4
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to T to eat.	4
Never have I had such dramatic T (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.	2

We were 4 and got the family size T which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.	1
The T was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol	1

This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best T in New York.	1
What really makes it shine is the T, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	1

Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else.	5
It is so romantic.	4
Its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go.	4
Most of the T allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.	4
The T is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.	1
I've enjoyed 99% of the T we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring).	1

The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left.	4

The T are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.	4

Servers are all different, T is my favorite.	2
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a T who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.	2
This is the first place I've been that a T remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.	2
Prices are fair across the board for both T and bev.	3

The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the T came, it was average.	1
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in T at the bottom.	1
I showed it to the T, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).	2
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.	2
The T finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.	2
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.	2
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared T.	1
For a T with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.	5

My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the T can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.	1
Still we keep going back :)	5
I was speechless by the horrible T.	1
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the T was majorly disappointing.	1
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the T presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).	2

In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.	1

One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)	5
Everything on the T is great. 	1

Look, the T were really good.	1
The T was also very good.	1
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.	3
What you are paying for is the T and the name.	4
Yes, the T is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.	4

T was good but not amazing.	1
T was quite excellent however.	1
T: pure disaster.	1
Just not good at all.	1
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.	1

Our experience did not ever get any better.	5
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.	2
We also asked for Hooka six times and the T kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.	2
After the 4th time i asked again and the T than said after our dinner.	2
We asked for beverages and never received them.	2
We asked for sides which the T than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.	2
My T was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.	1
I would not expect this for a $55 T.	1

By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!	2
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!	2
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!	2
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.	5
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good T and belly dancers!	1

Don't go with a larger group than 4! 	5
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.	2
The T is fairly simple without much descriptions. 	1
There was no tap T that evening, which was a disappointment. 	1
Not much of a T either, we went with Brahma. 	1

I had the T...which was very good. 	1

All in all the T was good - fresh. 	1
A little on the expensive side. 	3
"T not the friendliest to our ""large party""! "	2
Probably would not go back here.	5
T was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.	1
"Very ""normal T"", but done really well."	1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just T - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	3

Also, T try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.	2
I don't appreciate T or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	2

I have never been so disgusted by both T an service.	1
I have never been so disgusted by both food an T.	2
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.	2
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my T before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	1

My main concern was the sanity of the T that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	1

None was made so i hung up.	2
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.	1
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten T, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	1

This is undoubtedly my favorite T (that don't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!	4
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden T, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate d'cor will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.	4

The T were served with miso soup and rice.	1

Terrible would be a compliment!	5
The T leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.	2
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!	2
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.	2
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible T we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!	2

I tried a couple other T but wasn't too impressed.	1

Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the T.	4

Dumbfoundingly Poor	5
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.	5
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.	2
The T at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.	2
Polite acknowledgement is out;	2
supercilious scorn is in.	2
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	2
A different T enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	2

I took one bite from the $24 T, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	3
At this point, the T comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.	2
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the T was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.	1
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.	1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.	1
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."	2
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!	2
This is where it really really gets bad: the T said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.	2
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!	2
The level of rudeness was preposterous.	2
The T came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.	2

It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 	3
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the T - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	2

The frizzy retro T (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	2
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"	2
I'd be horrified if my T were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	2
"There's another T who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "	2
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 	2
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	2
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better T. 	2

While finishing our meals which included a high-end T, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	1
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a T in a restaurant.	2
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	2
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the T's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."	2
If you go here, do it on his off-night.	2

Had an awful experience at T on a Saturday dinner.	5
Appetizers took nearly an hour.	2
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.	2
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.	2
The T was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.	2
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.	2
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.	2

"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the T said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""	2
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.	2

The T delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	2
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	2
The T came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	2
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	2
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	2
I wish I could like this T more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.	5

Wine list is extensive without being T.	3

We are very particular about T and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
That's cheap... what more could you ask for?	3
The T are dry, tasteless.	1
The T are  way overpriced.	3
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.	2

But that is highly forgivable.	2
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap T - this is the place.	3
The restaurant has a Family T, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.	4
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining T.	5

I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.	4
Over the years the host, T, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	2

Worst T I Ever Had	2
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst T we had ever received.	2
Our T was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.	2
I complained to the T, but he was not even apologetic.	2
I will never return again.	5

I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the T here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.	1
T is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.	1
Rice is too dry, T wasn't so fresh either.	1
Nothing really came across as outstanding.	1

I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the T to be excellent.	1

On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three T waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.	2

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.	2
I don't know if I'll be back....	5
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great T.	5
the only problem is you really have to warm up the T before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	1
BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.	1
Best T in town.	1
Everything you want and more, very fresh.	1
Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.	2

NOT THE T IT ONCE WAS	5

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the T of this establishment.	2
"This T really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS ""DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of."	5
"Perhaps now, T falls into the ""Dive"" category."	5
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.	5
I hope one day T returns to what it once was.	5
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.	5

There is only one T on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.	5
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: T.	5
Cut to the chase - this is amazing!	5
It's unpretentious and underground.	4
It's fresh and delicious.	1
It's welcoming and relaxing.	4
Hands down, the best T I have ever had.	1
T lives up to it's fantastic reputation.	5
I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again.	5
What a find!	5
Well worth it 	5

Love it every time 	5
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this T is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.	5
The T is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.	1

The only problem would be the T, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.	2
Never had one single problem there.	5
T Plus	1
– This was  great dining experience.	5
If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.	5
The T made a perfect entre for my wife.	1
T was the best.	1

Leave room for T.	1
COMPLETELY OVER RATED!	5
The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the T was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	1
The food was ok, but the T was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	2
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.	2
We had a very hard time getting the T' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.	2
As it turns out the T was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.	2
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.	2
It was clear he didn’t really care.	2
AVOID THE T	5
– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.	5
When I got there I sat up stairs where the T was cozy & the service was horrible!	4
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the T was horrible!	2
I waited for 10-15 minutes for T ordered a beer & was never served again.	2
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.	2
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the T about the non existent service & deceptive link.	5
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.	5
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the T had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.	2
We left without ever getting T.	2
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.	5
Best T in Town	1
– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the T myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.	1
If you can, come to this T by boat and make it a whole evening.	5

She doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.	2

Management should really take notice and train their T and teach them some proper manners.	2

best T i have tasted in a long time	1
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.	4
the T of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.	4
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.	4
the T was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.	2
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.	2
so about the T, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	1

not chewy at all.	1
for desert we had the T... oh la la yummy!!!	1
melt in your mouth.	1
we are for sure coming back to this T.	5
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.	5
Chintzy T	1
– The T here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	1

Terrible T, food ok, pricey	2

Terrible service, food ok, pricey	3
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.	2
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!	2
None that I can think of.	2
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.	2
Um so now what are appetizers for???	2
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.	2
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.	2
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'T scale'.	2
T wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	1

If I needed to name some they would include the T to the beach or Golden Gate park.	4
Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.	4
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.	5
Another plus is the open T of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.	4

T gets better each time I have it.	1
It isn't the cheapest T but has been worth it every time.	3
Very poor T.	2

While this diner had reasonably good T, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	1
While this diner had reasonably good food, the T seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	2
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;	2
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.	2
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	2
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a T, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	2
"A brief conversation with the T at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been ""blown off"" would be an understatement."	2
"The T continually interrupted with ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience."	2
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.	2
In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	2
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for T...then this might be the place.	1
the T was fresh, though it was cut very thin.	1
T here!	1
– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality T.	1
And they give good T for the price.	1
And they give good quantity for the T.	3
We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked T for dinner!	5
I love T and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!	1
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the T.	1
I ended the meal with the unusual T....yummy!	1
And the T was simply spendid - quite a delight.	2

You Can't Go Wrong Here.	5

– I decided to eat at Stack because of their T.	3
When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible T.	4
The T playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.	4

I got the T and it was alright.	1
It wasn't the freshest T ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.	1
I picked the T, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.	1
The T came next and it tasted great, at least initially.	1
The T was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.	1
It?s served with either a T or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or T, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the T.	1
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.	1
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.	1
The T was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.	1

The specialty here is decadent T, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.	1
Nothing on the T is less than amazing.	1

Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use T that's half-way decent.	1

Delectable 	1
It's a tiny T so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.	5
Once you're inside, the real experience begins.	5
Everything, and I mean everything on the T is delectable.	1
The T are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.	2
The T is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!	1

The T itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.	1
I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.	5
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.	5

The T are big though, so do not order too much.	1
Groovy T made the dinner casual.	4
The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.	3
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the T which was odd.	5
The T itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.	5
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.	5
This T rocks!!	5

Insultingly Overpriced	3
- Mediocre T/Quality	2
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those T that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.	4

To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of T will cost you $3.	3
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small T at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	1

I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their T was so unique that I continued.	1
"The pancake were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancakes (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different T) is well over-priced."	1

On my meal I had to send back my T for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.	1

I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the T and I was too frustrated to continue.	1
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no T stopped by to ask what the problem was.	2

Much more than just a great T!	4
Much more than just a great view!	5
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at T last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	5
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous T, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	4
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the T are only the third-best thing about Ray's!	4

To start things off, our lovely server T was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	2
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous T, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1

For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the T complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	1
The T are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	1
My friend enjoyed the T with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.	1

I had a taste of all three items on her T, and they were superb.	1
Our T continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	2

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.	5
All considered, I have to say that T is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.	5
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful T and food made the experience a very positive one.	2
